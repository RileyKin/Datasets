HOW TO CITE THE STUDY:

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (www.cses.org). CSES MODULE 3
SECOND ADVANCE RELEASE [dataset]. March 31, 2011 version.

These materials are based on work supported by the American National 
Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) under grant numbers SES-0451598 and 
SES-0817701, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the 
governments of several German Länder, the University of Michigan, in-kind
support of participating election studies, the many organizations that 
sponsor planning meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that 
fund election studies by CSES collaborators.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions, or recommendations expressed
in these materials are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the funding organizations.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ADVANCE RELEASES:

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is an "Advance Release"
of CSES Module 3 (2006-2011).
 
By definition, an Advance Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset.  Many
election studies that will eventually be present in the CSES Module 3 Full 
Release are not available in this file. 

Advance Releases are provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset.  We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".  

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the naming, data,
and documentation of variables and election studies that appears in an 
Advance Release file.  If users wish to re-use their programming code on
a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that is
flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for
CSES Module 3 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which may 
impact their analyses.  To view errata for CSES Module 3, go to the Data
Center on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 3 download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the gray box to the right of the page.

We hope that until such time as the Full Release of CSES Module 3 is
available, users will find this and future CSES Module 3 Advance Releases
to be helpful in their work.

         | NOTES: C1010
         |
         | These variables report the original weights provided with
         | the respective deposited data files.
         |
         | Sample weights include those intended to correct for unequal
         | selection probabilities resulting from "booster" samples,
         | procedures for selection within the household, non-response,
         | as well as other features of the sample design.
         |
         | Demographic weights adjust sample distributions of socio-
         | demographic characteristics to more closely resemble the
         | characteristics of the population.
         |
         | Political weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         | electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the
         | official vote counts.
         |
         | In cases where a collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables.  Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is not available, these
         | variables are coded 1.

         | Because of non-response the sample is not an exact
         | representation in terms of equal distribution of known
         | demographic characteristics of the Austrian population. 
         | A demographic sample weight is included that adjusts sample 
         | characteristics to known population estimates, which were taken
         | from census data carried out by Statistics Austria.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C1010_2
         |
         | The election study has been weighed to correct for demographic
         | characteristics of the population as reported in the official
         | demographic census PNAD2003. Weights were calculated on basis 
         | of 1000 respondents.

         | A weight has to be used to control for the demographic marginal 
         | (region, settlement, size, sex, age, etc.). The weight has been 
         | calculated on the base of the Croatian Census data of 2001.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CROATIA (2007): C1010_3
         |       
         | A weight is necessary to control for the political
         | marginal (region, settlement, size, sex, age, education) 
         | according to the election results. The weight has been 
         | calculated on the base of the Croatian Census data of 2001.
 
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C1010_1
         |
         | This weight controls for unequal probabilities of selection, 
         | especially due to random draw in households of unequal size, 
         | defined as the product of the probability of selection of the 
         | i-th observation in its PSU and the corresponding probability of
         | selecting this observation in its household.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C1010_2
         |
         | The demographic weight is designed to match the population 
         | distribution on gender, age, education, occupation and 
         | household size.
         | All these variables have been considered in their French 
         | definition, which do not match international classifications. 
         | Existence of bias after weighting depends on these various 
         | definitions of categories.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C1010_3
         |
         | The political weight controls for political skewness, computed
         | to correct for a bias on the aggregate electoral results of 
         | legislative elections. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C1010_1
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C1010_1
         |
         | Due to the German history, the eastern part of the country is 
         | over-sampled. To study Germany as a whole, C1010_1 is needed to 
         | correct for this kind of the sample selection. 
         | In addition, C1010_1 also controls for skewness in relevant 
         | socio-demographic characteristics within each of the German 
         | federal state, as it is done by C1010_2.
         | In contrast, researcher interested in comparing both parts of
         | Germany separately, should not make use of C1010_1.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C1010_2
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C1010_2
         |
         | According to drop-outs, non-responds and incomplete interviews,
         | C1010_2 controls for potential skewness in relevant socio-
         | demographic characteristics. The weight corrects for age-groups
         | and sex within each region. To study Germany as whole, C1010_1 
         | has to be used exclusively to control for the over-sampling of 
         | East Germany as well as for potential skewness of socio-
         | demographic characteristic. Consequently, a combination of both 
         | weights is not necessary.
     
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C1010_2
         |
         | A sample weight is included to correct for skweness in the 
         | distribution by age, sex, and the region of residence, according 
         | to the sampling process. As a benchmark, the "Age and Sex 
         | profile of registered electors by Legislative Council 
         | Constituencies in 2010" has been used, available at the website 
         | of the Hong Kong Registration and Electoral Office.
         | Note that there were 63 cases with missing values in the 
         | submitted weight variable. These cases are coded zero (0) in 
         | C1010_2.

         | The data set includes a weight variable (C1010_2) for age, as
         | proportionally fewer in the younger age groups replied to the
         | survey compared to the distribution of age in the population
         | according to information from Statistics Iceland.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2007): C1010_2
         | 
         | A cross-sectional weight variable (C1010_2) was included to 
         | adjust sample totals to the population using the Gross minimum 
         | distance algorithm. These population totals are from the 2006 
         | Census and the Quarterly National Household Survey in terms of 
         | household size (number of adults age 18 and over), age, sex, 
         | education, economic status, marital status and region.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2007): C1010_1
         |
         | As the implementation of the CSES Module 3 points out, Japan 
         | used two different samples. Consequently a weight is necessary
         | to make the sample representative of the population being 
         | studied and to compensate bias of potential skewness in relevant
         | demographic factors. The weight included in the original data
         | file was constructed by strata of six layers of age (20s, 30s,
         | 40s, 50s, 60s, and over 70) and gender, based on the frequencies
         | of Population Census of Japan 2005.

         | The Mexican data includes two different weights. C1010_1 
         | corrects for unequal probability of selection of sampling units.
         | C1010_2 is post-stratification weight that adjusts for non-
         | response and matches the sample to known demographic 
         | characteristics of the population (gender and age).

         | The demographic weight includes the characteristics age, 
         | gender, marital status, urbanization, region, ethnicity. It 
         | is based on all respondents participating in wave I and II 
         | (the original weight variable wgt3).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2006): C1010_3
         |
         | The political weight includes voting turnout as an additional
         | population characteristic. It is based on all respondents
         | participating in wave I and II (the original weight variable 
         | wgt4).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2008): C1010_2

         |
         | Both Polish datasets include a demographic weight to make the 
         | sample comparable to the overall Polish population. 
         | Researcher should be aware of the fact that the construction 
         | rules as well as the used data for benchmark are actually 
         | unknown.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2009): C1010_2
         |
         | The data include a demographic weight to make the sample 
         | comparable to the overall Portuguese population aged 18 years or
         | older. The weight is based on the distribution of the target 
         | population in terms of gender, age, and education, according to 
         | the Portuguese National Statistics Office Census 2001. 
         | In the source file, 13 cases had system missing values in the 
         | weight variable. The reason is that in these cases, at least one
         | variable used to calculate the weight (gender, age and 
         | education) is a missing value. In CSES dataset, these cases are 
         | imputed the average weight score from the source file (.999881).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007): C1010_1
         |
         | The sample weight is based on the size of the electorate of each
         | canton and adjusts for over-sampling of certain cantons in the
         | survey sample.
         |
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007): C1010_3
         |
         | This is a cumulative weight that corrects for sample biases in
         | party choice and turnout while taking cantonal over-sampling 
         | into account.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2008): C1010_2

         | These variables report standardized versions (with a mean 1
         | within the polity) of the original weights provided with the
         | component election studies, described in C1010. They are the
         | ratio of each weighting factor to the mean weight (C1011) of
         | each type, calculated within each polity.
         |
         | The derivative "Polity Weight" (C1012) has been created so
         | that for each weight (sample, demographic, political), each
         | respondent within the election study has a mean weight of "1".
         | If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         | will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         | approximately the same as the number of interviews in the
         | study. This derivative weight is created by dividing the
         | individual weight for each respondent within an election
         | study by the mean for that weight for all respondents in that
         | election study.

         |
         | This variable reports the ratio of the average sample size to
         | each election study sample. Note that this factor is calculated
         | on the basis of the samples appearing in the CSES data files
         | (i.e. does not incorporate booster samples, panel respondents
         | who did not participate in the CSES wave of multi-wave studies,
         | etc.). Further, this factor treats elections, and not political
         | systems, as the unit of analysis. Analysts wishing to compare
         | across-countries, instead of across-election studies, should
         | adjust this weight accordingly.
         |

         | These variables are intended for micro-level analyses involving
         | the entire CSES sample. Using the sample size adjustment
         | (C1013), the centered weights (C1012) are corrected such that
         | each election study component contributes equally to the
         | analysis, regardless of the original sample size. Users are
         | advised to read the notes of the preceding variables carefully
         | so as to ensure that their analyses will be weighted
         | appropriately.
         |
         | The derivative "Dataset Weight" (C1014) has been created so
         | that each election study in the dataset will contribute
         | equally to analyses of respondents, regardless of the number
         | of interviews in each election study.
         |
         | To follow is the SPSS code used to create variables
         | C1014_1, C1014_2, and C1014_3:
         |
         | replace C1014_1 = C1012_1 * C1013
         | replace C1014_2 = C1012_2 * C1013

         |
         | Due to the compulsory school attendance, covering pupils aged 
         | 6 to 15, a category for 1 "no education" was not used in the
         | German questionnaire. Researcher interested in the German 
         | compulsory school attendance should take note that Germany 
         | is a federal state and that the regulations for education 
         | are in the hand of the federal state governments.
         | Hence, the length of compulsory education may vary across 
         | federal states. 
         | Furthermore, code 4 "incomplete secondary" was not in use in 
         | Germany. People who have not achieved the minimum level of 
         | qualification normally required to enter university are instead 
         | coded as 3 "primary completed". 
         | Finally it has to be noted, that Germany distinguishes between 
         | two different types of university, a general university as well 
         | as an university of applied sciences and an university of 
         | engineering.
         | The classification of these types of educational institutes to 
         | the CSES codes are:
         |

         |        05.     SECONDARY COMPLETED covers all persons who

         |        08.     UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE COMPLETED  
         |                including persons having achieved a minimum level 
         |                of university education, e.g. Bachelor, Master or
         |                the German Diploma.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C2003
         |
         | To classify respondent's level of education Germany used a 
         | modified scheme of the ISCED-1997. First, the CSES level 
         | 4 INCOMPLETE SECONDARY was replaced by the ISCED-code 2 for
         | LOWER SECONDARY. In detail, this category includes people with 
         | a full implementation of basic skills, entering after some 6 
         | years of primary education, or those who left school after the 
         | compulsory education, ending after 9 years since the beginning of 
         | primary education. 
         |
         | Second, the CSES category 5 SECONDARY COMPLETED was replaced by 
         | the ISCED category 3 HIGHER SECONDARY, covering respondents, who
         | have at least the minimum qualifications normally required to 
         | enter into university, or any other degree level of higher 
         | education, but who have never entered a university or other 
         | degree level course of higher education. 
         | Finally, according to the compulsory schooling in Germany, the
         | use of CSES categories 2 INCOMPLETE PRIMARY and 3 COMPLETE 
         | PRIMARY is not applicable.

         | Note that in the Icelandic election Study respondents were asked
         | three questions regarding education:
         | a) if he/she was attending school,
         | b) at what degree/education respondent had finished and
         | c) if respondent had started a school or studying for a degree
         |    but not finished (dropped out).
         | The response categories for each question were a list of 54
         | different degrees or level of education and possibility to write
         | in an explanation about respondent's education. These variables
         | were then used to calculate the education level as used by CSES. 
         | Due to a coding problem there may be single cases of persons
         | on a vocational training who already hold a university degree,
         | which is not reported.

         | "What is your highest level of education? (If you had 
         | quit school or are currently in school, please choose that

         |        01.     01. Married or living together as married

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C2004
         |
         | The original marital status variable had separate response
         | categories for 'Married' ("Marié(e)"), 'Living together
         | as married' ("Vit en concubinage") and PACSÉ, (Pacte Civil de 
         | solidarité) which is a contractual partnership between 2 people
         | of legal age to organize their life in common.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2007): C2004
         |
         | Note that in Ireland C2004 lays emphasis on the legal status
         | of marriage, thereby under-representing in code 1 those who
         | are not married, but are living together as married.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2006): C2004
         | 
         | As most of the demographic variables, the marital status  
         | variable has been added to the datafile by Statistics 
         | Netherlands on the basis of population records. Therefore, the 
         | variable is based on the legal definition of being married or in 
         | registered partnership. As a result, there is a number of 
         | respondents coded as not married in V422 but also as having "a 
         | partner that is a  member of the household" according to V440 
         | (the variable based on interview records). 
         | In order to bring this variable closer to the CSES definition of
         | C2004, respondents with a partner in household were coded as 
         | "1." in C2004 regardless of their code in the original marital 
         | status variable, unless they were coded "2. Single" or "7. 
         | Parent in single parent household" in variable "V423 Place of 
         | respondent in household". In the latter case the cases remained 
         | in their original marital status categories. 
         | Note that this adjustment reduces the skip pattern inconsistency
         | between C2004 and variables dealing with spouse's socio-economic
         | status (C2015), but does not eliminate it.

         |
         | In the Swiss survey, category "01. Married or Living Together as
         | Married" does not include those "Living Together as Married".
         | In contrast living together with a partner was asked in a single
         | variable. The combination of both equates the given category 
         | "01. Married or Living Together as Married".
         | The combination yields some cases that mentioned  
         | widowed (eleven cases), divorced (90 cases) or single (244 
         | cases), but are living together with a (new) partner. These 345
         | observations have been defined as "01. Married or Living 
         | Together as Married".

         |        01.     01. married or living as married

         | However, there are several cases, e.g. pilots or public 
         | employees unions, which are close to associations of 
         | professions. Consequently, the German data include some

         |
         | Note that round 21% of respondents in a trade union also report
         | membership in an employer's association. This could be partly
         | due to the similarity of the words employer and employee in the
         | Czech language. Some respondents may thus have misunderstood
         | question C2007. However, this may only affect answers to C2007
         | and not C2005 since in C2005 the wording was "trade union
         | membership".

         | matching or even collapsing for C2011. The variable is therefore

         | Note that the categorization in the data originally
         | contained 4 digits. This was shortened to our two-digits use 
         | of the ISCO-88. For a greater level of details we refer to       
         | the original data in the Irish Election Study. Some values of
         | the original codes suggest that ISCO-08 from 2008 was used.
         | However, since the broader two-digit code stayed largely the 
         | same with the change from ISCO-88 to ISCO-08, the transfer of
         | the codes looks appropriate. Only one code, not represented in

         |
         | The categories are intended to distinguish among the following
         | groups:
         |
         | 1. White Collar:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in non-manual
         | labor: Managers, salaried professionals, office workers,
         | sales personnel, and proprietors are generally included in
         | the category.
         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Includes, for example entrepreneurs, shop keeper,
         | professionals like lawyers, medical doctors etc.
         | 
         | Note that there is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status 
         | (C2010) affected the application of the follow-up occupation 
         | variables (C2011-C2014). The CSES standard is that the 
         | occupation variables are asked from those in labor force. 
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in 
         | labor force in C2010 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may 
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses 
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor 
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.
         |

         | For respondents who are currently employed, this variable 
         | reports their present socio-economic status. Those respondents
         | who reported in this question that they are retired or currently
         | not working (Finish election study codes 7-11, see below) were 
         | coded as missing. 
         | However, note that there are several cases of persons who
         | report being unemployed or retired in C2010, but do report a 
         | socio-economic status with values 1-3 in C2012. According to the
         | collaborator for the Finish election study, there is a high 
         | probability that respondents answered question C2012 in
         | compliance with their last status before unemployment/retirement 
         | - and, thereby responded to C2012 in the same way in which the 
         | previous question (C2011) had been asked.

         | Note that there is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status 
         | (C2010) affected the application of the follow-up occupation 
         | variables (C2011-C2014). The CSES standard is that the 
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force. 
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in 
         | the labor force in C2010 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables  
         | may report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses 
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in the  
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last 
         | occupation.

         | In the DPES, Marital status (V422) and presence of a partner in 
         | household (V440) are separate variables. Since the former 
         | emphasized the legal status of being (not) married, there are 
         | several respondents coded "never been married" in V422 and 
         | having a partner present in the household. As a result, there 
         | are a number of cases in CSES who are not coded as married in
         |  C2004 but with valid codes in the spouse variables 
         | (C2015-C2019).
         |
         | The DPES provides a reduced number of categories for this

         | Five variables were used to derive C2015:
         | Bak1 What is your current marital status?
         | Bak14 Is your spouse/partner currently in a paid employment?
         | Bak15a What is your spouse/partner's most important activity or

         | Bak16c What is your spouse/partner primary occupation?

         | Furthermore, the original categories used in the Swiss

         | (1) This variable reports the respondent's spouse's main
         | occupation; that is, the job at which the respondent's
         | spouse spends most of the time, or if the respondent's
         | spouse spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is
         | the one from which the respondent's spouse earns the most
         | money.  For spouses who are currently employed, this variable
         | reports their current occupation. For spouses who are retired
         | or not currently working, this variable reports the spouse's
         | last occupation.
         |
         | (2) Coding conventions employ the first two-digits of 1988
         | ISCO / ILO International Standard Classification of
         | Occupations Code from the International Labor Office, CH-1211,
         | Geneva 22, Switzerland.
         |
         | In some cases it has not been possible to strictly adhere to the
         | ISCO/ILO conventions.  Users will find that some categories have
         | been added to the ISCO/ILO list in order to accommodate the
         | occupations of respondents who were not easily classified.
         | Please refer to specific Election Study Notes for clarification 
         | of additional codes.
         | 
         | There is variation in the manner the questions about
         | respondent's spouse were administered in different election
         | studies. In some cases only those categorized as "married or
         | living together" in C2004 were asked the spouse questions,
         | while in some surveys other categories could also get these
         | questions.

         | New Zealand regional differences are weak, primarily based on        
         | historical settlement patterns, and political differences 
         | between them. They can usually be decomposed into 
         | socio-demographic variables. 
         |
         | Regions have been defined by grouping electoral districts into
         | the following: 
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Category
         |        01.     Northland (north of Auckland)

         |        06.     South Island
         |          
         | Of these, Auckland and the South Island stand out as the most
         | distinctive politically, with the South Island assumed to be 
         | more conservative in its voting habits and Auckland, the largest
         | city and commercial centre, tending to be associated with 
         | change. Wellington, the capital, is to some extent shaped by its
         | greater concentration of public sector employment.

         | This is an open-ended question. Collaborators coded this 
         | variable in a detailed way and with a minimum of at least
         | twenty categories.
         | Note that in a number of election studies, there were cases with
         | equal codes in C3001_1 and C3001_2. In the current release this 
         | has been treated inconsistently - in some studies the repeated 
         | mentions were coded into missing, while in others it remained 
         | unchanged. In future releases this problem will be solved in a 
         | consistent manner. For details see election study notes.

         | This is an open-ended question. Collaborators coded this 
         | variable in a detailed way and with a minimum of at least
         | twenty categories.
         | 
         | Note that in a number of election studies, there were cases with
         | equal codes in C3002_1 and C3002_2. In the current release this 
         | has been treated inconsistently - in some studies the repeated 
         | mentions were coded into missing, while in others it remained 
         | unchanged. In future release this problem will be solved in a 
         | consistent manner. For details see election study notes.

         | mentioned up to 6 problems for C3002_1 and 35 respondents up
         | to 5 mentions for C3002_2. For both variables only the first
         | mention was used. An exception was made for a few singular     
         | cases in C3001_1 which only gave a meaningful second mention.
         | In those cases, the second mention of the most important
         | problem was used.

         | which did not mention a most important sociotropic problem in 
         | C3002_1, but named a second problem in C3002_2. 
         | In contrast, the corresponding respondents mentioned a party to 
         | solve the given problem in C3003_1, but not in C3003_2.
         | In the actual CSES data, reported answers on the second 
         | sociotropic problem were coded as most important problems, while 
         | the second mention was defined as a missing value for all of

         | (or it does not matter)," to "for whom people vote for is 
         | important (or it matters)."
         | In the Russian questionnaire, it reads: "Some people consider 
         | that it does not matter for who people vote for because it does 
         | not make a difference. Others say that it matters for who to 
         | vote for because it makes a difference. What is your opinion? 
         | Please locate your position  on a five-point scale, where ONE 
         | means that it does not matter for who to vote for, and FIVE 
         | means that it matters for who to vote for."

         | Respondent's evaluation on the National Democratic Party (NPD),
         | was not part of the micro-questionnaire.
         | In contrast, the NPD is included in the district-as well as in

         | In the Russian questionnaire, the wording refers more to 
         | support, rather than strongly like- strongly dislike. The 
         | question ranges between "does not support at all" to "greatly
         | support." While in Hebrew, the chosen terminology varies in 
         | terms of "attraction/repulsion".

         Q10a-i. And what do you think of the presidential candidates/party
         leaders? After I read the name of a presidential candidate/party  
         leader, please rate them on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means 
         you strongly dislike that candidate and 10 means that you strongly
         like that candidate.  If I come to a presidential candidate/party 
         leader you haven't heard of or you feel you do not know enough 
         about, just say so.  The first is [LEADER A].

         | Data are not available for AUSTRIA (2008).
         |
         | Researcher should pay attention to the fact that C3010 includes
         | several observations, which scored all leaders equally, namely
         | for BELARUS (2008), GERMANY (2009), HONG KONG (2008), SOUTH
         | KOREA (2008), MEXICO (2006 & 2009), POLAND (2005), SWEDEN

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2008): C3010_E
         |
         | C3010_E refers to Julia Gillard, member of the Australian Labor

         |
         | This variable was not included in the Austrian Election Study 
         | because it was considered to be less applicable in Austria.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C3010_I
         |
         | Note that the A-F scheme of parties and party leaders here
         | represents the most popular parties according to the 
         | parliamentary elections' vote shares in descending order. 
         | For party F we do not have any information. Heloísa Helena,
         | from party P-Sol only played a minor role in the parliamentary
         | votes' results but was important in the presidential election.
         | She was thus added to letter I.
         | Note that in the election study from Brazil there were also
         | questions about two candidates from governor's elections, José
         | Serra (PSDB) from São Paolo and Aécio Neves (PSDB) from Minas 
         | Gerais.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C3010_D
         |

         |
         | As a representative of party E (The Greens) Joschka Fischer 
         | was mentioned in the German questionnaire. However, researchers 
         | should note that J. Fischer resigned from leadership in 1998 
         | but still remainsthe most important politician of the
         | German Greens.

         | results of parties' vote share. In contrast, respondents were
         | not asked to evaluate the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions 
         | (PARTY E), thus it consists of missing values.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2007): C3010_A-C3010_F

         |
         | The Polish questionnaire did not evaluate the like-dislike scale
         | for a leader of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - POLAND (2005): C3010_G
         |

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - POLAND (2005): C3010_I
         |
         | The Polish study asked respondents to evaluate both of the 
         | Kaczynski brothers on the like-dislike-scale. Due to the fact
         | that both played a major role in the 2005 election, information
         | for Jaroslaw Kaczynski was kept in an additional variable 
         | C3010_I, while Lech Kaczynski was kept in C3010_A.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2008): C3010_G
         |
         | This question was asked slightly differently in South 
         | Korea. Instead of an open-ended question, important 
         | politicians were named in the questionnaire, 
         | excluding leaders form party G (New Progressive Party). 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2008): C3010
         | Note that unlike other countries, the question considered two
         | leaders from each parties. Given that in this presidential
         | election, voters select both president and vice president, 
         | both figures are important here.
         | Also note that answers "It's hard to say" and "No opinion" were
         | recoded as "Don't know".

         | NOTES: C3011
         | 
         | Researcher should be aware that C3011 includes
         | several observations that scored all parties equally, namely
         | for BELARUS (2008), HONG KONG (2008), and TAIWAN (2008). 
         | In addition, in BRAZIL (2008), CROATIA (2007), the CZECH 
         | REPUBLIC (2006), GERMANY (2009), FINLAND (2007), ISRAEL (2006), 
         | SWEDEN (2006), THAILAND (2007), and TAIWAN (2008) some 
         | respondents mentioned to have never heard about the left-right  
         | scale for some parties, while they evaluated other 
         | parties on the left-right spectrum. Finally, the data for BRAZIL
         | (2008), CROATIA (2007), the CZECH REPUBLIC (2006), JAPAN (2007), 
         | SWEDEN (2006), and THAILAND (2007) include several observations 
         | that mentioned to have never heard about the left-right scale
         | when placing themselves (C3013),whereas they scored parties on 
         | it. See also variable notes on C3013.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C3011_G
         |
         | Respondent's evaluation on the National Democratic Party (NPD),
         | was not part of the micro-questionnaire.
         | In contrast, the NPD is included in the district- as well as in
         | the macro-part of the CSES data.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C3011
         |
         | Researchers should be aware that there are major 
         | differences between the sample mean of party evaluation on the 
         | 'left-right'-scale and the expert scoring, especially for the 
         | League of Democrats, the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and
         | People's Livelihood, and the Liberal Party. Accordingly, our 
         | collaborators pointed out that the "Left-Right division has a 
         | complicated meaning in Hong Kong. There are at least 3 
         | dimensions: (1) 'left' for 'pro-Beijing' (...), and 'right' for 
         | 'pro-KMT' (KMT stands for Kuomintang, the ruling party in China 
         | before 1949 and Taiwan after 1949); (2) 'left' for advocating 
         | liberal / socialist / anti-market socio-economic policies, and 
         | 'right' for advocating conservative / capitalist / pro-market 
         | policies; and (3) 'left' for approving a radical approach to 
         | fighting for rights and changes, and 'right' for disapproving a 
         | radical approach. The three dimensions do not coincide for 
         | individual parties. Some parties are pro-Beijing, advocating 
         | liberal / socialist / anti-market socio-economic policies, but 
         | disapprove a radical approach (e.g. Democratic Alliance for 
         | Betterment of Hong Kong). Other parties are advocating liberal /
         | socialist / anti-market socio-economic policies, and approve a 
         | radical approach to fighting for rights and changes (e.g. League
         | of Social Democrats)."
         | In contrast, the expert score was based on the assessment of the
         | parties according to the second dimension, while respondents 
         | might have given their score based on one rather than other 
         | dimensions.
         |
         | In general, the order of parties A to I follows the election 
         | results of parties' vote share. Respondents were
         | not asked to evaluate the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions
         | (PARTY E), thus it consists of missing values.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2007): C3011_A-C3011_F
         |
         | Note that in the Irish Election Study two codes had been labeled
         | as 'Don't know'. Only the one derived from the questionnaire was
         | coded into the CSES 'Don't know' value 8. All answers with code 
         | 99, labeled as 'Don't know' were recoded as missing data.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2006 and 2009): C3011
         |
         | Note the somewhat unusual distribution of the Left-Right ratings
         | of the parties, leaning towards the extremes. Note also that the
         | party placements highly correlate with the evaluation of the 
         | corresponding parties on the like-dislike scale. The 
         | authenticity of the data have been verified with the 
         | collaborators . These features seem to represent relatively 
         | consistent features of the survey results in Mexico, reported 
         | across time, and by various survey projects (e.g., 
         | Latinobarometro, WVS). 
         | For more insight into the results obtained using Left-Right 
         | scales in Mexico, consult Beltrán, 2009.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2009): C3011_G
         |
         | Researchers should be aware of the fact that in comparison with 
         | the expert evaluation, respondents' mean differs by about 1.5 
         | points. Our Portuguese collaborators emphasize that this might 
         | be due to differences in the criteria of evaluation: "Experts 
         | made their evaluation taking into account not only the position 
         | of the party regarding economic issues but also regarding (...)
         | moral issues, and others like the position of CDS/PP facing 
         | criminality. This positions the party the right spectrum, (...).
         | In the case of the respondents, their evaluation probably 
         | concentrated on more salient issues - namely economy - where the
         | position of the party is closer to the center, (...)."

         | There is no question asking about leaders/candidates for these 
         | last two parties.

         | Note that in the Brazilian questionnaire, rather than "degree of
         | closeness" the respondents were asked how strongly they liked
         | the party. Also, those respondents who named a party 
         | they liked "at least a little more" than other parties, could
         | evaluate the strength of this feeling with an eleven point scale.

         | to you," without the nuances offered in the body of the

         | Australia has compulsory voting, hence this questions had not 
         | been part of the Australian questionnaire in 2007. C3021_1 was 
         | created using the actual vote choice for the House of 
         | Representatives (B11REPS), defining all observations as non-
         | voters that reported an "informal vote".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C3021_1
         | 
         | Note that although elections on multiple levels took
         | place on the same day, this question did not further specify the
         | election nor the type of ballot cast (1 or 2).
         | As the follow-up question "whom did you vote for" was asked for
         | all electoral levels (presidential, legislative candidate etc.)
         | separately, it is also not impossible to draw conclusions to
         | which part of the election respondents probably refer to with 
         | C3021_1. Also see C3031.
         | Also note that due to compulsory voting, non-voters have to
         | officially justify non-voting behavior on election day, if e.g.
         | they are absent from the city where they are registered. If for
         | other reasons they do not vote, and do not justify this, they
         | get fined with a symbolic amount of about US$2.
         | The original election study data from Brazil contained more
         | specific information for those who did not vote. For the sake         
         | of comparability, in the CSES study these were all recoded  
         | into value 5:

         | Because Australia has compulsory voting (see

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3022_1
         |          
         | The question was not open-ended. Instead, respondents could 
         | choose their answer from a party list with seven parties and the

         | Rather than an open-ended question, Finland provided a 
         | closed-list from which up to four parties were chosen by
         | respondents. Instead of providing a choice rank 1-4 here, in
         | C3022_1 are respondents' answers with one or more choices;
         | in C3022_2 those with 2 or more; in C3022_3 the ones who chose 3
         | or more and in _4 those who chose 4 parties. Due to this coding
         | no rank order could be provided.

         | In contrast, non-voters, according to C3021_1, were defined
         | on the basis of actual vote choice (B11REPS) - see C3021_1.
         | Moreover, respondents who reported an informal vote choice
         | were defined as non-voters according to C3021_1, but
         | retained as "informal voters" in C3023_LH_DC.

         |
         | The electoral system of Hong Kong Legislative Council 
         | distinguishes between geographical and functional 
         | constituencies. In both constituencies 30 members are 
         | elected. The functional constituencies are professionals
         | or economical and social interest groups. 
         | For the CSES data, only the vote choice of the geographical 
         | constituencies is included, in which all registered citizens are
         | eligible to vote.
         | Researchers interested in the individual vote choices within the
         | functional constituencies might contact our collaborator of 
         | Hong Kong (see introduction part) to get access to the data of 
         | origin. 
         | Finally, researcher should note that in 
         | contrast to the given coding schema, referring to parties, the 
         | original answers had been candidate mentions. Compared to 
         | C3028_LH_ and C3030_LH_, C3023_LH_DC only includes candidates'

C3026    >>> Q21E. CURRENT ELECTION: DID R CAST CANDIDATE PREFERENCE VOTE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         If an open-list electoral system was used for the legislative
         election in question and respondent cast a ballot:

         Q21e. This variable reports whether or not the respondent cast a 
         preference vote for a candidate. 

         For instance, if votes are cast for party lists, but citizens 
         can, in addition to that, mark a preference for one or more 
         candidates on the party list, then Q21e may show answers to a 
         question like this: "Did you simply vote for a party or did you 
         also express a candidate preference?" In party list systems where 
         voters have to vote directly for a candidate and cannot cast a 
         vote just for the party list as such (e.g. Estonia, Finland, the 
         Netherlands, Poland), the question for Q21e should read like this:
         "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         candidate?"

         | 
         | Data are not available for SOUTH KOREA (2008), TAIWAN (2008). 
         | Same is true for the follow up questions C3028. 
         |
         | The CSES questionnaire skips non-voters, according to
         | C3021_1-C3021_2, from C3027_PR-C3027_UH, as well as from the 
         | follow-up questions C3028_PR_1-C3027_UH_9. In contrast, several 
         | country studies asked these questions to all respondents,  
         | irrespective of their current electoral participation. 
         | Such data remained unchanged.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C3027_LH
         |
         | Note that the German data of 2005 include one non-voter, 
         | according to C3021_1, who answered C3027_LH. These data remained
         | unchanged.
         | However, although this respondent mentioned
         | "no" in C3027_LH, it does not affect C3028_LH_1.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2009): C3027_LH
         |
         | Note that the Mexican data of 2009 include five non-voters, 
         | according to C3021_1, who answered C3027_LH. These data remained
         | unchanged.
         | However, although these respondents mentioned
         | "no" in C3027_LH, it does not affect C3028_LH_1 to C3028_LH_3.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2008): C3027_LH
         | 
         | Note that in the case of New Zealand this variable refers to
         | both party and candidate vote. If respondents considered voting
         | for either party or candidate, the question was coded with
         | 1 - yes. 
         | 
         | To distinguish between party and candidate vote considerations
         | of respondents, researchers are advised to look at
         | C3028_LH_1-8. Within C3028_LH_1 to C3028_LH_4 respondents' 
         | answers to the question if they considered for other party 
         | votes are included. C3028_LH_5 to C3028_LH_9 is meant for 
         | respondents' answers to the question if they considered for 
         | other candidate votes. See also note C3028_LH_01-C3028_LH_08.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007): C3027_LH
         |
         | The Swiss 2007 election was held simultaneously for both lower
         | and upper houses (with the exception of 5 of the 46 seats of
         | this last one). However, the employed question to measure the
         | current variable makes explicit reference to the lower chamber.  
         | The translation is: "At the recent National Council elections,
         | did you consider the possibility of voting for some other party 
         | than the one you actually voted for?"
         |
         | Also, please take note that this variable was asked to a subset  
         | of the sample which responded to a follow-up mail/online 
         | questionnaire. See study description and variable note C1007 
         | for further details.

         | NOTES: C3028_LH_1-C3028_LH_9
         |
         | In the original questionnaire these questions were intended to
         | capture spontaneous answers, with the respondent mentioning a
         | set of parties, and the recorded values indicating the order of
         | response. However, some studies have been asking these questions
         | with a predetermined list of political parties, and asking about
         | one party at a time. By asking these questions in this way, the
         | order of the responses is lost. See country notes for details
         | about which countries employed a predetermined list question
         | format.
         |
         | Additionally, when asked about one party at a time, a minority
         | of respondents end up mentioning many more parties than usual.
         | To avoid adding many columns with extremely sparse data, we have
         | included up to 9 variables with the intention to secure
         | registering, if applicable, responses that refer to parties A
         | through I. Moreover, whenever a respondent mentioned more than
         | 9 parties we included only those responses that refer to parties
         | A to I. With this coding rule, we are only dropping the 
         | responses from two survey respondents (each from Finland and
         | Sweden).
         | Note that variables 5 to 9 do not necessarily represent any
         | order of response. For details, see country notes.
         | 
         | Please note that this solution is temporary and might be 
         | subject to change and modifications in future releases as the 
         | CSES Secretariat will continue researching alternative 
         | solutions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007): C3028_LH
         |
         | The Australian questionnaire of 2007 allowed mentioning of only
         | one party respondents would have voted for.             

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3028_LH_1
         |          
         | The question was not asked open-ended. Instead, respondents
         | could choose their answer from a party list with seven parties 
         | and the options "other party" and "no party". Respondents who
         | answered "no party" but had reported that they had considered
         | voting for others were recoded as missing. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CROATIA (2007): C3028_LH
         |
         | The original questionnaire of CSES points out to ask this 
         | question to each person, no matter if the current respondent
         | participated in the actual election. However, in the case of 
         | Croatia C3028_LH was only asked to current voters.
         |
         | The Croatian questionnaire of 2007 allowed respondents to 
         | mention up to five parties. However, no more than three 
         | mentions were given by any single respondent. In the
         | case of Croatia, variables of C3028 reflect the preference 
         | order of respondents.
   
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2007): C3028_LH
         |
         | Finland provided a closed-list of answers in which up to four
         | parties could be chosen by respondents. Instead of providing a 
         | choice rank 1-4 here, in C3028_1 are respondents' answers with 
         | one or more choices; in C3028_2 those with 2 or more; in C3028_3
         | the ones who chose 3 or more and in C3028_4 those who chose 4 
         | parties. Due to this coding, no rank order could be provided.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2007): C3028_LH
         |
         | France asked this question separately for each party. The 
         | variables for C3028 do not reflect any preference order.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C3028_LH_1
         |
         | The original CSES questionnaire instructs interviewers to ask  
         | this question to each person, no matter if the respondent
         | participated in the current election or not. However, in the 
         | case of Germany, C3028_LH was only asked to current voters.
         |
         | The German questionnaire of 2005 allowed mentioning only one 
         | party respondents would have voted for.   
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C3028_LH_1-C3028_LH_3
         |
         | Researcher should take care about the fact that in contrast to 
         | the given coding schema, referring to parties, the original 
         | answers had been candidate mentions. Compared to C3023_LH_DC, 
         | C3028_LH_ also includes candidates' parties outside respondents'
         | geographical constituencies.
         | For further information see variable note on C3023_LH_DC.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ICELAND (2007): C3028_LH_1-C3028_LH_5 
         |          
         | Note that apart from the party codes 1-6 (see appendix) the
         | Icelandic Election Study used 4 additional answer options
         | for these questions.          
         |          
         | CSES Code      Election Study Category/Categories:        
         |        93.     Yes, all other parties
         |        94.     Yes, not to vote
         |        95.     Yes, to cast an invalid / blank ballot

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ICELAND (2007): C3028_LH_1
         |
         | Note that all persons who refused to answer if they did
         | consider voting for another party (C3027_LH) or answered 
         | "don't know" to this question, have the same answer codes 
         | in the follow-up question C3028_LH_1.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ICELAND (2009): C3028_LH_1         
         |          
         | Note that 37 persons told they would have voted "all of them"    
         | This was coded as 96 "invalid ballot".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2007): C3028_UH
         |
         | The original CSES questionnaire instructs interviewers to ask  
         | this question to each person, no matter if the respondent
         | participated in the current election or not. However, in the  
         | case of Japan, C3028_LH was only asked to current voters.
         |
         | Rather than an open-ended question, Japan provides a closed-
         | list for the five major Japanese parties, listed in the codebook
         | appendices. Consequently, these variables do not reflect any 
         | preference order. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2006): C3028_LH
         |
         | The Dutch survey reports this question separately for each 
         | party. The variables for C3028 do not reflect any preference
         | order, but rather, if each party was mentioned by respondents.
         |

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2008): C3028_LH_1-C3028_LH_8
         |     
         | Note that there is no rank order between variables 
         | C3028_LH_1 to C3028_LH_8. Respondents' choices of "other 
         | parties" appear in variables C3028_LH_1 - C3028_LH_4
         | if they chose from 1 up to 4 other parties.
         | 
         | C3028_LH_5 - C3028_LH_8 were used as variables for the choice
         | of other candidates from the candidate list vote.
         | C3028_LH_5 contains respondents' one "other choice", 
         | C3028_6 a second "other choice", and so forth up to C3028_LH_8
         | with respondents' fourth "other choices" but all not rank
         | ordered.
         | 
         | Code 9 always means that the person chose one of the "other 
         | parties" or "other candidates" which are not represented in
         | parties 1-8 "Legalise Cannabis", "Family", "Kiwi",
         | "Libertarianz", "NZ Pacific", "Bill and Ben", "Workers" and
         | "Other party, not specified".
         | 
         | Note that by accident of coding there are two persons who 
         | reported not to having considered voting for either other
         | party or candidate, who in C3028_LH_5 tell they would have
         | voted for one of the candidates of "other parties".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2005): C3028_LH
         |
         | The original CSES questionnaire instructs interviewers to ask  
         | this question to each person, no matter if the respondent
         | participated in the current election or not.  However, in the 
         | case of Norway, C3028_LH was only asked to current voters.
         |
         | The Norwegian questionnaire of 2005 allowed mentioning only one 
         | party respondents would have voted for.

         |
         | Note that the Polish studies used closed lists to ask 
         | respondents about parties they considered voting for in the 
         | Lower House. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWEDEN (2006): C3028_LH
         |
         | Sweden asked this question separately for each party. The 
         | variables for C3028 do not reflect any preference order, but
         | rather, if each party was mentioned by respondents.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007): C3028_LH
         |
         | This variable was applied differently in the Switzerland survey.
         | Respondents were asked whether they considered voting for each 
         | party separately. Accordingly, order of responses in the data 
         | set does not reflect order of responses of respondents. 
         | Additionally, responses make reference to lower house contest.
         | See note C3027_LH for further details.
         | However, the additional mention variables C3028_LH_5 to 
         | C3028_LH_9 refer to party mentions.
         | Also notice that this variable was asked to a subset of the 
         | sample which responded by a follow-up mail/online questionnaire.
         | See study description and variable note C1007 for further 
         | details.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2007): C3028_LH
         |
         | Thailand asked this question separately for each party. 
         | Respondents were asked to name an unspecified number of parties,
         | consequently variables of C3028 do not reflect any preference
         | order.
         | However, the additional mention variables C3028_LH_5 to 
         | C3028_LH_8 refer to party mentions.

         | follow-up questions C3030_PR_1-C3030_UH_9. In contrast, several

         | The Swiss 2007 election was held simultaneously for both lower
         | and upper houses (with the exception of 5 of the 46 seats of 
         | this last one). However, the question (translated as "Is 
         | there one or more parties that you would not ever vote for?") 
         | was applied immediately after variables C3027_LH and C3028_LH,

         | NOTES: C3030_LH_1-C3030_LH_9
         |
         | In the original questionnaire these questions were intended to
         | capture spontaneous answers, with the respondent mentioning a
         | set of parties, and the recorded values indicating the order of
         | response. However, some studies asked these questions
         | with a predetermined list of political parties, and asked about
         | one party at a time. By asking these questions in this way, the
         | order of the responses is lost. See country notes for details
         | about which countries employed a predetermined list question
         | format.
         |
         | Additionally, when asked about one party at a time, a minority
         | of respondents end up mentioning many more parties than usual.
         | To avoid adding many columns with extremely sparse data, we have
         | included up to 9 variables with the intention to secure
         | registering, if applicable, responses that refer to parties A
         | through I. Moreover, whenever a respondent mentioned more than
         | 9 parties we included only those responses that refer to parties
         | A to I. With this coding rule we are only dropping less than
         | 1% of the responses contained in the entire sample.
         |
         | Please note that this solution is temporary and might be 
         | subject to change and modifications in future releases as the 
         | CSES Secretariat will continue researching alternative 
         | solutions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007): C3030_LH
         |
         | Australia asked this question separately for each party. The 
         | variables for C3030_LH do not reflect any preference order.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3030_LH_1
         |          
         | The question was not open-ended. Instead, respondents  
         | could choose their answer from a party list with seven parties  
         | and the option "other party".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CROATIA (2007): C3030_LH
         |
         | The original CSES questionnaire instructs interviewers to ask  
         | this question to each person, no matter if the respondent
         | participated in the current election or not. However, in the 
         | case of Croatia, C3030_LH was only asked to current voters.
         |
         | The Croatian questionnaire followed the implementation for CSES
         | closely, allowing respondents up to five party mentions at most. 
         | However, no more than four parties have been mentioned by any 
         | single respondent.
         | The variables of C3030 reflect the preference order of the
         | corresponding respondent.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2007): C3030
         |
         | Rather than an open-ended question, Finland provided a 
         | closed-list from which respondents could choose as many answers
         | as they wished. Instead of providing a choice rank 1-4 here, in
         | C3030_1 are respondents' answers with one or more choices;
         | in C3028_2 those with 2 or more; in C3028_3 the ones who chose 3
         | or more and so forth. Due to this coding, no rank order could be
         | provided.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2005): C3030_LH
         |
         | The German questionnaire of 2005 asked this question separately 
         | for each of the parties which contested in the national 
         | election. Hence, the given variables do not reflect any 
         | preference order of the respondents.
         | However, the additional mention variables C3030_LH_5 to 
         | C3030_LH_9 refer to party mentions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2009): C3030_LH_5-9
         |
         | Variables C3030_LH_5 to C3030_LH_9 refer to additional mentions
         | of parties respondent would never vote for. However, the order 
         | of variables reflect the order of respondent's party mentions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): C3030_LH_1-C3030_LH_2
         |
         | Researcher should note that in contrast to 
         | the given coding schema, referring to parties, the original 
         | answers had been candidate mentions. Compared to C3023_LH_DC, 
         | C3030_LH_ also includes candidates' parties outside respondents'
         | geographical constituencies.
         | For further information see variable note on C3023_LH_DC.
         | Moreover, according to the explanations of our collaborators, 
         | the label "'independents' in Hong Kong means 'not affiliated 
         | with any political parties' and does not necessarily mean that 
         | the candidates' political inclinations are different from those 
         | of major political parties".

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2007): C3030_UH
         |
         | Rather than an open-ended question, Japan provides a closed-
         | list for the five major Japanese parties (see codebook 
         | appendices). Consequently, in the case of Japan, figures in
         | C3030 do not reflect any kind of preference order.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2006): C3030_LH
         |
         | The Dutch survey reports this question separately for each 
         | party. Up to 13 mentions were recorded. CSES retained mentions
         | of parties A through I. The variables for C3030_LH do not 
         | reflect any preference order, but rather, if each party was
         | mentioned by respondents.

         | Note that there is no rank order. Respondents' choices of 
         | "parties never vote for" appear in variables C3028_LH_1
         | - C3028_LH_4 if they chose from 1 up to 4 other parties.
         | Code 9 always means that the person chose one of the "other 
         | parties" or "other candidates" which are not represented in
         | parties 1-8 "Legalise Cannabis", "Family", "Kiwi",
         | "Libertarianz", "NZ Pacific", "Bill and Ben", "Workers" and

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWEDEN (2006): C3030_LH
         |
         | Sweden asked this question separately for each party. The 
         | variables for C3028 do not reflect any preference order, but
         | rather, if each party was mentioned by respondents.
 
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2007): C3030_LH
         |
         | This variable was applied differently in the Switzerland survey.
         | Respondents were asked which parties they would not vote for 
         | by asking for each party separately. Accordingly, order of 
         | responses in the data set does not reflect any rank order of 
         | respondents preferences. Additionally, responses make reference 
         | to lower house contest. See note C3029_LH for further details.
         | Also note that this variable was asked to a subset of the 
         | sample which responded by a follow-up mail/online questionnaire.
         | See study description and variable note C1007 for further 
         | details.
         | However, the additional mention variables C3030_LH_5 to 
         | C3030_LH_9 refer to party mentions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2007): C3030_LH

         | Thailand asked this question separately for each party. The 
         | variables for C3030 do not reflect any preference order.
         | However, the additional mention variables C3030_LH_5 to 
         | C3030_LH_8 refer to party mentions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007): C3031
         |
         | Australia has compulsory voting, hence this questions was not 
         | part of the Australian questionnaire in 2007. C3031 was 
         | created using the actual vote choice for the House of 
         | Representatives (B17), defining all observations as non- voters
         | that did not report a vote choice, according to C3032_LH_DC.
         | Researcher should note that some of the included 
         | non-voters in C3031 might not have been eligible to participate 
         | in the previous election.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C3031
         |          
         | This variable was dropped in the Austrian Election Study 
         | because of the late timing of the study and the
         | considered likelihood of inaccurate recall.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELARUS (2008): C3031

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006): C3031
         | 
         | Although elections on multiple levels took
         | place on the same day, this question did not further specify the
         | election nor the ballot cast (1 or 2).
         | As the follow-up question "whom did you vote for" was asked for
         | all electoral levels (presidential, legislative candidate etc.)
         | separately, it is also not impossible to draw conclusions to
         | which part of the election respondents probably refer to with 
         | C3021_1. Also see C3021_1.
         | Also note that due to compulsory voting, non-voters have to
         | officially justify non-voting behavior on election day, if e.g.
         | they are absent from the city where they are registered. If for
         | other reasons they do not vote, and do not justify this, they
         | get fined with a symbolic amount of about US$2.
         | The original election study data from Brazil contained more
         | specific information for those who did not vote. For the sake         
         | of comparability, these were all collapsed under value 5 as

         | choice of the previous election refer to the EU parliamentary
         | (EP) election of June 7th, 2009. In general CSES does not 
         | include data from any other electoral tier than the national 
         | one. Hence, data had been deleted and information about a
         | previous Portuguese election is not included.
         | Researchers, who are interested in the data about the EP-
         | election might get back to our Portuguese collaborators, as
         | listed in the introduction part of this codebook.

         If an open-list electoral system was used for the legislative
         election in question and respondent cast a ballot:

         preference vote for a candidate in the PREVIOUS election.  
         
         For instance, if votes are cast for party lists, but citizens 
         can, in addition to that, mark a preference for one or more 
         candidates on the party list, then Q23d may show answers to a 
         question like this: "Did you simply vote for a party or did you 
         also express a candidate preference?" In party list systems where
         voters have to vote directly for a candidate and cannot cast a 
         vote just for the party list as such (e.g. Estonia, Finland, the 
         Netherlands, Poland), the question for Q23d should read like this:
         "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         candidate?"

         | voters it was 18.03 %. The turnout for the total electorate, in 
         | Croatia and abroad, was 57.17%.
         | The number of registered voters in Croatia is 4,073,630, which  
         | is 494,630 more than the estimated number of voting age  
         | population who live in Croatia. The difference may be caused by 
         | two factors: voters living temporarily abroad, but registered 
         | as voters in Croatia (and not in the 11th district for Diaspora 
         | voters) and inaccuracy of voters registers. Additional 404.950

         | More specifically, and according to collaborator, in Mexico

         | Commission (IFE), they have to go back to pick up a valid ID
         | that IFE issues called "Padrón" (Electoral Roll). Some 
         | citizens who requested their voting ID-Card do not claim it 
         | afterwards, and these ID's are destroyed since they can not 
         | show a valid ID on election day, and thus, they cannot vote. 
         | The list of those who registered and got their valid ID is 
         | called the "lista nominal" which is the actual list of voters.

         | extraordinary effort done in the 1990's, in a house by house 
         | visit the Electoral Commission made a census of all eligible  
         | voters. Independent estimates found that this original census 
         | covered close to 98% of the voting age population of the time
         | (persons 18 years older and more). These differences indicate 
         | that the actual list of eligible voters ("lista nominal") has
         | not been fully updated, most likely because of deceased voters
         | who are not erased from the list. Another likely source of error
         | might be due to errors in the estimate of age in limited census 
         | of 2005.

         | collaborator. This decision is largely based on the fact that, 
         | for all the political parties, the average score on the left-
         | right scale is also 5 in the micro part of the data.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2006):  C5019
         |
         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   055. Re-election of president Lula. (At the time of
         |        election, President Lula had high levels of 
         |        government approval).
         |   056. Public debate about privatization and the role of state. 
         |        President Lula as candidate has emphasized the role of 
         |        state in economy and social policies. The main adversary
         |        (PSDB Alckmin) emphasized the positive aspects of 
         |        privatization.
         |   057. The role of media. Some political specialists affirm
         |        that the second round of election only happened because 
         |        President Lula didn't appear in a campaign debate at 
         |        television 3 days before the day of election. All surveys 
         |        reported that President Lula would win for Presidency in
         |        the first round, due to his wide approval and popularity.
         |   058. Corruption crisis affecting the president Party (PT). In 
         |        2005 there was a corruption scandal involving some 
         |        politicians in the National Congress and some political 
         |        parties, related to electoral financing campaign in 2002 
         |        and benefits to politicians at Parliament.
         |   059. Social Programs. Bolsa Familia, a redistribution of 
         |        income program was the landmark of the government, it 
         |        changed the geographic distribution of votes for Lula to
         |        the poor areas of the country; the vote for Lula was 
         |        historically concentrated in the richer areas of the 
         |        country, identified to left vote.

         |
         |   026. Ideological and party loyalty of the voters of the two 
         |        major parties, HDZ and SDP
         |   027. New party leader of the SDP, who mobilized additional 
         |        volatile voters
         |   028. Favorable economic trends supporting the ruling HDZ
         |   029. Open support for the HDZ by the Catholic Church
         |   030. Several contested issues: voting rights for the Croatian
         |        citizens living abroad questioned by the SDP, threat by 
         |        the SDP to introduce tax on profits from stock market
         |        shares.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (2006): C5019
         |
         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   107. Economic issues concerning taxation, social welfare and
         |        health care.
         |   108. The election campaign featured negative personal attacks
         |        on political opponents: A week before Election Day, with 
         |        the assistance of MPs of the opposition ODS and governing
         |        KDU-CSL, a secret report by Police Colonel Kubice was 
         |        published, pointing to possible links between the then
         |        Prime Minister and CSSD Party leader, Paroubek, and  
         |        organized crime. For ODS and other parties, the 
         |        publishing of the secret report was a way to criticize 
         |        the corrupting and 'mafia-like' style of CSSD's politics.
         |   109. A day before the elections were to take place, in the 
         |        editorials of three out of four major dailies, the 
         |        editors in-chief recommended that voters did not vote for
         |        the Communists or Social Democrats, but that they cast 
         |        their vote in favor of liberal and conservative parties.
         |   110. Unexpected increase in the support of Green party between
         |        January to March 2006 from almost nothing to 7 percent.

         |
         |   063. Cleavage between labour movement and non-socialist 
         |        parties, which was intensified by the campaign ads of the
         |        central labour federation.
         |   064. Disagreements on the possibilities for increasing
         |        welfare services and benefits, and on the possibilities
         |        to reduce taxes   
         |   065. Unemployment
         |   066. Benefits of the elderly people
         |   067. The so called premier campaign: the suitability of the 
         |        party leaders of the three biggest parties to serve as 
         |        the prime minister.

         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   021. Result of the previous presidential elections
         |        (won by Nikolas Sarkozy, UMP)
         |   022. Change in Party Strategy from the UDF (embodied in the 
         |        Change of name UDF MoDem): left the traditional 
         |        right-wing Alliance but no agreement came to force with 
         |        the left wing parties
         |   023. Debate about "Social VAT" (new government appointed by 
         |        the new President reasserted than an increase of VAT to
         |        decrease salary charges was possible); more salient
         |        between first and second round.
         |   024. Environment (new government was created with a 
         |        particularly large ministerial department for environment; 
         |        sustainable growth was put to the fore)
         |   025. European integration (after the no to the European 
         |        constitutional treaty in May 2005, debates about how
         |        should the new treaty be designed and consequently 
         |        ratified in France)

         | 
         |   111. Tensions between Hong Kong and Beijing: When the tensions
         |        between Hong Kong and Beijing are high, more voters tend 
         |        to vote for candidates from pro-Hong Kong parties; when 
         |        tensions are low, more voters tend to vote for candidates
         |        from pro-Beijing parties.
         |   112. Government performance: When the government performs 
         |        well, more voters tend to vote for candidates from pro-
         |        government parties; when the government performs badly, 
         |        more voters tend to vote for candidates from anti-

         |   113. Policy orientation or stance of parties (e.g. minimum 
         |        wage legislation).

         | A more detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election is included here:
         |
         |   123. The government had to pay the consequences of the 
         |        financial crisis of 2007-2009. Even though, the public 
         |        finances did not suffer severe consequences, and the 
         |        exchange rate peso-dollar did not suffer sudden and 
         |        drastic changes, GNP dropped dramatically and 
         |        unemployment spread. Therefore, the perception that the 
         |        Government did not respond in the best way to solve these
         |        problems extended, causing a great discontent and 
         |        frustration in the population. 
         |   124. The problem of crime, specially the "Drug War" - an armed
         |        conflict between rival drug cartels and government forces
         |        -, produced a lack of credibility in the Government (PAN)
         |        because the persistence of violence and murders related 
         |        to this issue.
         |   125. The former left candidate of the PRD, Andrés Manuel López
         |        Obrador, did not recognize his defeat in 2006, and has 
         |        been campaigning across the country under two small 
         |        parties (Convergencia and PT). This has created strong 
         |        problems for the leftis parties in two senses. On the one
         |        hand strong rejection of López Obrador among many 
         |        segments of the population and, strong divisions among 
         |        the parties. This deteriorated their credibility.
         |   126. General dissatisfaction with the political actors.

         |
         | For lower house elections, Australia employs the Alternative 
         | Vote system (see note C5065). In this system, voters are 
         | required to list their  preferences for as many candidates 
         | as there are on the ballot. Thus, the total number of votes 
         | varies across electoral districts.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2004): C5038_3
         | 
         | For upper house elections, Australia employs a single-
         | transferable-vote form of proportional representation. In this
         | system each voter indicates the order of preference among all 
         | the candidates in competing in her district, or alternatively, 
         | she can indicate support for a party ticket (which determines 
         | the order of preference of candidates within the party).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C5038_1
         |
         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation
         | system with three segments or tiers. These correspond to the 
         | regional districts tier, the Land level tier (or state level) 
         | and the federal (or national) level tier. Counting and 
         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels. 
         | However, voters cast a single vote. In this vote, they can 
         | express preferences for specific candidates, particularly, a 
         | Lander level candidate and/or for a regional level candidate.
         | However, since voters cast a single vote only, this system is
         | different from systems with multiple tiers where voters vote 
         | separately in different tiers. Hence, the system is coded as 
         | consisting of a single tier in variables C5038-C5047.

         | renewed alternately every 4 years. In 2002, two-thirds of the
         | senate was renewed, and therefore voters had two votes in the
         | upper house election - each electoral district gave two 
         | senators. By contrast, in 2006 only a third of the senate was 
         | renewed, giving voters a single vote in these upper house

         | returned by geographic constituency (popular) elections; the
         | other half is returned by functional constituency elections.
         | Data on Hong Kong electoral institutions refer to the 
         | geographical constituency elections only.
         | Eligible individuals can register as an elector in both
         | Geographical Constituency and Function Constituency. But, 
         | because of the restrictive franchise of the latter, there is 
         | less than 8% of the electors in the Geographical Constituency 
         | are eligible and registered in the Functional Constituency. In
         | geographical constituency elections, each elector can cast 1 
         | vote.
         | In functional constituency (FC) elections, electors normally 
         | have 1 vote. But there are complications as the electors of some
         | functional constituencies are not "individuals", but 
         | corporations or organizations of which their owners and/or

         | two electoral segments, for 6 years term, where half of the 
         | members (121) stand for re-election every three years. The first 
         | segment consists of 47 prefecture-level districts where 73 
         | representatives in each election are chosen by simple majority.

         | Mexican voters cast a single vote in a single member district
         | plurality election. However, this also counts for the allocation
         | of the proportional representation seats disputed in the larger 
         | regional multi-member districts (five circumscriptions). Thus, 
         | voters are not allowed to split their vote, in fact, the same 
         | vote is subject to a double counting that produces two-seat 
         | relevant vote totals. The first vote total determines who wins 
         | the plurality in the single-member district (300 seats). The 
         | second serves to allocate seats in the multi-member districts 
         | (200 seats).The PR seats are allocated according to the 
         | aggregate distribution of votes of multi-member districts, which
         | excludes non valid votes, votes for parties that obtained less 
         | than 2% and votes for non-registered candidates.

         | For senatorial (Upper House) elections, voters cast a single 
         | vote in 3-seat multi-member districts (which correspond to the
         | country's 31 states plus the Federal District). The first two 
         | seats are awarded to the plurality winner and the third seat is
         | given to the first runner-up. This vote also counts for the 
         | allocation of proportional representation seats disputed in one
         | national district. Thus, each vote is subject to a double 
         | counting that produces two-seat relevant vote totals. The first
         | vote total determines who wins the in the multi-member districts
         | (96 seats), and the second serves to allocate through 
         | proportional representation the resting 32 seats. For the 
         | allocation of the PR seats the national distribution of votes
         | excludes non valid votes, votes for parties that obtained less

         |
         | Under the 2007 Constitution, a new electoral system was adopted, 
         | reintroducing a modified version of a previous form of electoral 
         | system (the one preceding the 1997 constitution). The previous 
         | (1997-2006) 400 single-seat districts were combined into larger 
         | districts: 4 single-seat, 63 with 2 seats, and 90 with 3 seats. 
         | These constituencies use the Block Vote (BV) system which allows 
         | voters to cast as many ballots as there are seats in a district.
         | Voters are not permitted to cast all their votes for a single
         | candidate but can split their votes between candidates nominated
         | by different parties, for a total of 400 seats. Parallel to this
         | tier, 80 seats are distributed according to PR list, in 8 
         | regional  constituencies of roughly equivalent proportions, 
         | without a threshold. Each party submits a list with 10 
         | candidates who are listed once, and who can also contest 
         | constituency seats.
         
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2007): C5038_1

         | Given the dependence of how many votes can be cast on district 
         | magnitude (and that this varies as well across districts), we 
         | could not provide a single value for this indicator. There are 
         | respectively, 4 constituencies with a single seat (1 vote), 63 
         | constituencies with 2 seats (2 votes) and the last 90 
         | constituencies with 3 seats (3 votes), for a total of 400 seats.

         | Voters are allowed to vote for only one party list. The party

         Q16b. Do they vote for candidates (not party lists) or party 
         lists?
         Definition: Party bloc voting is used in multi-member districts 
         where voters cast a single party-centered vote for their party of 
         choice; the party with the most votes wins all of the district 
         seats.

         Q17. Are the votes transferable?
         Definition: In systems with preferential voting, a voter can 
         express a list of preferences. For example, votes can be cast by  
         putting a '1' in the column next to the voter's preferred 
         candidate, a '2' beside their second favorite candidate and so on.
         Votes are counted according to the first preferences and any 
         candidates who have achieved the predetermined quota are elected.
         To decide which of the remaining candidates are elected the votes  
         are transferred from candidates who have more than the necessary 
         number to achieve the quota and from the candidate with the least 
         number of votes. An example of this is the election in Ireland 
         in 2002.

         | In some plurality systems, a threshold is established for a
         | declaration of "official party status" rather than for the
         | acquisition of seats in the legislature. Usually, these
         | thresholds are a certain number of seats, rather than a
         | percentage of the popular vote. For countries in which this 
         | is the case, this variable was coded "97. NOT APPLICABLE".
                  
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008): C5045_1

         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation
         | system with three segments or tiers. These correspond to the 
         | federal level tier, the Land level tier (or state level) and the
         | regional districts tier. Counting and allocation of seats passes 
         | through each of these levels, and as a consequence is a three
         | step process. An electoral threshold exists within them. In 
         | first place, in each Lander a Hare quota is calculated and used
         | to distribute seats across the regional district level. Followed
         | by this seats are allocated at the Land level tier but only 
         | those parties that obtained one seat at the regional district 
         | level or 4% of the nationwide valid vote are qualified to 
         | receive seats. Finally, at the national level seats are 
         | distributed following the D'Hondt system and seats that have 
         | been already allocated are discounted.

C5054    >>> REGIME: TYPE OF EXECUTIVE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Classification of political regimes in which democracies are 
         distinguished by the type of executive (0 Dictatorship, 
         1 Parliamentary Democracy, 2 Mixed Democracy, 3 Presidential 
         Democracy). 
         
         The following decision rule is applied (see Cheibub, 2007):
         A. The system is parliamentary either (i) if there is no 
         independently (indirectly or directly) elected president or (ii) 
         if there is an independently (indirectly or directly) elected 
         president but the government is not responsible to the president.
         B. The system is mixed either if there is an independently 
         (indirectly or directly) elected president and government is 
         responsible to the president.
         C. The system is presidential if government is not responsible to
         the elected legislature.

         NOTE: Responsibility refers to whether the survival of the 
         executive depends directly on legislature (i.e. vote of 
         confidence).

         | presidential regime given that the president can dissolve the

         | but he may avail himself of this prerogative only once for the

         | Classifying the finish executive power is subject to some 
         | controversy. Here it is coded as a mixed or semi-presidential 
         | system. Some key features of the Finnish system that distinguish
         | it from a traditional parliamentary system are that by 
         | constitution a) the president is popularly elected by direct 
         | vote for a fixed term of six years, and for no more than two 
         | consecutive terms of office; b) the president can, on 
         | recommendation of the prime minister, dissolve the legislature; 
         | c) the president can veto legislature, though parliament can 
         | override the presidential veto with a simple majority; and 
         | d) the president may issue decrees that have force of law. More
         | details can be  found in Fish & Kroenig, 2009. That said, some
         | scholars argue that Finland -especially after constitutional 
         | reforms in the 1990's- works in practice as a parliamentary 
         | system. See Raunio, 2009 for an example.

         | Note that Hong Kong is not a sovereign state, but a Special 
         | Administrative Region (SAR) in China. The Central Government 
         | authorizes the HKSAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy and 
         | enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power. 
         | Therefore, the HKSAR Government is kind of local government.
         | The Chief Executive (CE) is the President of the Executive 
         | Council of Hong Kong and head of the Government of the Hong 
         | Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chief Executive is 
         | elected by an 800-member Election Committee. The elected CE 
         | must then be appointed by the Central People's Government.
         | Regarding the relationship between the CE and Legislative 
         | Council, the type of executive may be regarded as some form of a
         | presidential system, because the CE and the Legco members are 
         | returned by different elections. 
         | According to the Article 52, the CE must resign in case of 
         | refusal to sign a bill passed by a two-thirds majority of the
         | Legislative Council.

         | submit bill to parliament (Cheibub, manuscript). Regardless, 
         | the position is considered mostly ceremonial and symbolic.

         database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World, 
         1946-2000 (http://homepages.nyu.edu/~mrg217/elections.html).
         
         PLURALITY - the candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE - A candidate must win over 50% of the vote
         to win. If no  candidate wins this many votes, then there is a 
         runoff between the top two candidates.
         QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE - Each qualified majority system specifies
         a particular percentage of the vote that a candidate must win in 
         order to be elected in the first round. If two or more candidates 
         overcome these thresholds, then the one with the highest number of
         votes wins. The qualified majority systems vary in terms of the 
         electoral procedure that applies when these thresholds are not 
         met.
         ELECTORAL COLLEGE - The candidate that wins a plurality of the 
         electoral college votes wins.
         SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE - Requires voters to rank single 
         candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes are 
         transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The 
         candidates that obtains this quota first is elected.

C5058    >>> ELECTORAL FORMULA IN ALL ELECTORAL SEGMENTS (TIERS)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This is a variable indicating whether the country uses (i) a 
         majoritarian formula in all of its electoral segments (tiers), 
         (ii) a proportional formula in all of its electoral segments 
         (tiers), or (iii) a mixed formula.

         The definition of this variable is taken from Matt Golder"s 
         database about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World, 
         1946-2000 (http://homepages.nyu.edu/~mrg217/elections.html).
         
         MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are 
         considered majoritarian.
         PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that use
         party lists and those like the single transferable vote that do 
         not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided into 
         two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of 
         remainders) and highest average systems.
         MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional 
         electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in 
         practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier). 
         Mixed electoral systems can be divided into those in which the 
         two electoral formulas are dependent and those in which they are 
         independent.

         | The Austrian electoral system is a (non-mixed) proportional 
         | representation system with three segments or tiers. These 
         | correspond to the federal level tier, the Land level tier (or 
         | state level) and the regional districts tier. Counting and 
         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels, and as
         | a consequence is a three step process. In first place in each 
         | Lander a Hare quota is calculated and used to distribute seats 
         | across the regional districts. That is, parties are allocated 
         | seats from each regional district depending on how often they 
         | exceeded the Land level specified quota. Followed by this seats 
         | are allocated at the Land level tier also following the Land 
         | level quota. Finally, at the national level seats are 
         | distributed following the D'Hondt system. Seats that have been 
         | already allocated in the first and second tier are deducted from
         | from the number of seats each parties obtains at the national 
         | level. Only those parties that obtain more than 4% of the 
         | national valid votes or one seat from the regional 
         | constituencies qualify to receive seats from the Lander and 
         | National seat distribution. Given this last element the

         | However, it is important to notice that candidates may run in 
         | both the SMD districts as well as in the party list of the PR 
         | contest. These so-called "duplicate" candidates are restricted 
         | to run only in SMD constituency located within their PR bloc.
         | While this feature might create some implicit interdependence 
         | between the segments, Japan's system is coded as un-linked since 
         | the allocation of seats of each segment in done independently,
         | without considering the marginal results of the other segment.

         COEXISTENCE: This is a system in which some districts use a 
         majoritarian formula, while others employ a proportional formula 
         in a single electoral segment (tier). Coexistence systems are 
         independent mixed systems.
         
         SUPERPOSITION: This is a system in which a majoritarian and 
         proportional formula are applied in independent electoral 
         districts. 
         
         FUSION: This is a system in which majoritarian and proportional 
         formulas are used in an independent manner within a single 
         district.
         
         CORRECTION: This is a system in which seats distributed by 
         proportional representation in one set of districts are used to 
         correct the distortions created by the majoritarian formula in 
         another. Correction systems are a dependent form of mixed system.
         
         CONDITIONAL: This is a system in which the actual use or not of 
         one electoral formula depends on the outcome produced by the 
         other. Conditional systems are a dependent form of mixed system.

         |
         | The Austrian electoral system consists of three overlapping 
         | tiers. The first tier is made of 43 regional electoral 
         | districts, the second tier of 9 Land or state level electoral 
         | districts and the third tier of one nation-wide electoral 
         | district. The number of seats allotted to each Land ahead of an
         | election depends on its census number of resident citizens plus
         | registered Austrian expatriates. The Hare electoral quota used 
         | for seat allocation both in the first and second tier is 
         | calculated at the level of the second tier. In each Land the
         | electoral quota is calculated from the number of allotted seats
         | divided by the number of valid votes cast. The electoral quota
         | thus varies by Land and the same quota is applied to the first
         | tier seat allocation in the Land's regional electoral districts.
         | Seats allocated (and votes used up) in the first tier are
         | subtracted from the number of seats (and votes) available for
         | subsequent second tier allocation. The number of seats available
         | for third tier allocation is 183 minus the number of seats
         | distributed during first and second tier allocation. The same
         | rule determines the number of remaining votes available for 
         | third tier allocation. Participation in second and third tier
         | seat allocation is restricted to parties that have gained at
         | least one first tier seat or a minimum of 4% of valid votes
         | nation-wide. Seat allocation in the third tier is through the

         | concern voting in special electoral districts: 11th district for 
         | the so-called Diaspora voters (Croatian citizens who are not 
         | resident in Croatia) and 12th district for representatives of 
         | national minorities:
         |
         | In the 11th district there were 404 950 registered voters (2007) 
         | who permanently live outside Croatia. Voters cast votes for 
         | party lists registered in this electoral district. There is a 
         | specific rule for determining the number of seats allocated in 
         | this electoral district: the number of valid votes is divided by 
         | the average number of necessary to win a seat in the electoral 
         | districts 1-10.
         |
         | In the 12th district voters who are registered as members of 
         | national minorities can cast votes for individual candidates. 
         | For this purpose there are separate sub-districts for respective
         | national minorities or groups of minorities. The Serbian 
         | minority elects three representatives and voters can cast up to 
         | three votes for individual candidates.  One representative is
         | elected by members of the following national minorities who cast 
         | one vote for the individual candidates: Italian -  Hungarian - 
         | Czech and Slovak - Austrian, Bulgarian, German, Polish, Roma,
         | Romanian, Ruthenian, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Valachian and
         | Jewish - Albanian, Bosniak, Montenegrin, Macedonian and 
         | Slovenian. Voters registered as members of national minorities 
         | can forgo their right to vote in the 12th electoral district and

         | A candidate is elected if he/she gains an absolute majority or

         | an absolute majority of the first preference votes, a second

         | "The electoral system in Ireland is a proportional
         | representation single transferable vote system (PRSTV). Voters
         | put a '1' beside their most preferred candidate, a '2' beside
         | their second most preferred candidate, and so on. Voters can
         | express as many preferences as there are candidates running in
         | their constituency. On the first count, candidates are declared
         | elected if they attract enough first preference votes to pass a
         | specified threshold, which is defined separately for each
         | constituency according to the formula: [total valid votes/
         | (total number of seats +1) +1]. If a candidate is declared
         | elected on the first count, the second preferences of the
         | candidate's surplus votes (i.e., votes over and above the
         | threshold) are then distributed among the other candidates. If
         | this redistribution does not push any of the remaining
         | candidates over the threshold, the candidate with the lowest
         | number of votes is eliminated, then the second preferences of
         | the eliminated candidate's votes are redistributed. This process
         | of redistribution of surpluses and elimination of candidates
         | continues until all the seats in a given constituency are
         | filled." (For details, see Gallagher et al., 2003, Appendix 4).
         |
         | Owing to the quota formula: [total valid votes/(total number
         | of seats "+1") +1], the STV system in Ireland works similarly
         | as the party-list proportional representation which uses
         | the largest-reminder method with droop quota. Consequently,
         | C5065 of IRL_2007 is coded as 33.
         |
         | Please be careful that because Ireland uses STV instead of PR,
         | there are non-trivial differences between the electoral system
         | of Ireland and the other countries with the PR, for example,
         | "residual" votes go to the next preferred candidates in the STV
         | but in the PR to the next listed/ranked candidates, even though
         | both systems employ "droop" quota for the seats allocation.

         | There are 10 districts each electing 14 representatives from 
         | party lists or independent list. In addition to these 140
         | seats, 8 seats are attributed to national minorities through a 
         | 12th district, of which 3 go to the national Serbian minority 
         | and 5 go to other minorities. The 11th district is formed of 
         | the Croatian nationals residing outside Croatia. 
         | Representatives from this constituency are elected on  
         | the basis of a non-fixed quota. That is, the number of 
         | representatives is not fixed in advance for this constituency. 
         | The number is attached to the amount of valid votes in the 10 
         | national constituencies: more votes in the national 
         | constituencies lead to the election of less Diaspora MPs.

         | the Bundestag consisted of 614 seats because there have been 16 
         | additional seats. The SPD gained nine additional seats the CDU 
         | seven of them. In 2009 there have been again 598 seats to be 
         | distributed, in the end the Bundestag consisted of 622 seats 
         | because there have been 24 additional seats, the CDU gained 21,

C5090    >>> CONSTITUTIONAL FEDERAL STRUCTURE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Is the country federal?
         
         Federations are "compound polities, combining strong constituent 
         units and strong general government, each possessing powers 
         delegated to it by the people through a constitution and each 
         empowered to deal directly with the citizens in the exercise of 
         the legislative, administrative and taxing powers, and each 
         directly elected by the citizens." (page 12, Watts, 2008).

         Corrected Effective Number of Electoral Parties corrects for the 
         "other" category using the least component method of bounds 
         suggested by Taagepera (1997). The method requires calculating the
         ENEP (C5093) two times. One is treating the "other" category as a 
         single party and the second is calculating the ENEP as if every 
         vote in the "other" category belonged to a different party. The 
         CENEP is the mean of both measures.

C5096    >>> CORRECTED EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF PARLIAMENTARY PARTIES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Effective number of parliamentary parties (CENPP).
         
         Corrected Effective Number of Parliamentary Parties corrects for 
         the "other"" category using the least component method of bounds 
         suggested by Taagepera (1997). The method requires calculating 
         the ENPP two times. One is treating the "other" category as a 
         single party and the second is calculating the ENPP as if every 
         seat in the "other" category belonged to a different party. The 
         CENPP is the mean of both measures.

         | the large differences between the effective number of political
         | parties and the corrected measure stems from the very large 
         | number of independent candidates gaining a seat.
         | The residual category "other" in Belarus encompasses more than
         | 86 percent of the vote, and is entirely composed of independent
         | candidates.
