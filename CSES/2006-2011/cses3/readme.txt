Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)

CSES Module 3 (2006-2011) 
Second Advance Release
March 31, 2011

-----

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ADVANCE RELEASES:

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is an "Advance Release"
of CSES Module 3 (2006-2011).

By definition, an Advance Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset.  Many
election studies that will eventually be present in the CSES Module 3 Full 
Release are not available in this file. 

Advance Releases are provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset.  We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".  

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the naming, data,
and documentation of variables and election studies that appears in an 
Advance Release file.  If users wish to re-use their programming code on
a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that is
flexible and can be accomodating of these future changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for
CSES Module 3 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which may 
impact their analyses.  To view errata for CSES Module 3, go to the Data
Center on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 3 download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the grey box to the right of the page.

We hope that until such time as the Full Release of CSES Module 3 is
available, users will find this and future CSES Module 3 Advance Releases
to be helpful in their work.

  "cses3_codebook_part2_variables.txt"    codebook variable descriptions
  "cses3_codebook_part3_appendices.txt"   codebook appendices

  "cses3_rawdata.txt"                     the raw data file

  "readme.txt"                            this file
   
  "sas.zip"                               statements for use with SAS
  "spss.zip"                              statements for use with SPSS
  "stata.zip"                             statements for use with STATA

Instructions for reading the dataset into SAS, SPSS, and STATA are found
in the headers of the "run" files in the appropriate file above (sas.zip,
spss.zip, or stata.zip).  More detailed instructions can also be found in
