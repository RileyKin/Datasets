HOW TO CITE THE STUDY:

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (www.cses.org). CSES MODULE 3
SECOND ADVANCE RELEASE [dataset]. March 31, 2011 version.

These materials are based on work supported by the American National 
Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) under grant numbers SES-0451598 and 
SES-0817701, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the 
governments of several German Länder, the University of Michigan, in-kind
support of participating election studies, the many organizations that 
sponsor planning meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that 
fund election studies by CSES collaborators.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions, or recommendations expressed
in these materials are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the funding organizations.


===========================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ADVANCE RELEASES:

This dataset and all accompanying documentation is an "Advance Release"
of CSES Module 3 (2006-2011).

By definition, an Advance Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset.  Many
election studies that will eventually be present in the CSES Module 3 Full 
Release are not available in this file. 

Advance Releases are provided as a service to the CSES user community,
for those analysts who find it valuable to work with preliminary versions
of the dataset.  We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "cses@umich.edu".  

Users should expect future changes and improvements to the naming, data,
and documentation of variables and election studies that appears in an 
Advance Release file.  If users wish to re-use their programming code on
a future release of the file, the code should be written in a way that is
flexible and can be accommodating of these future changes.

Users of the Advance Release may also wish to monitor the errata for
CSES Module 3 on the CSES website, to check for known errors which may 
impact their analyses.  To view errata for CSES Module 3, go to the Data
Center on the CSES website, navigate to the CSES Module 3 download page, 
and click on the Errata link in the gray box to the right of the page.

We hope that until such time as the Full Release of CSES Module 3 is
available, users will find this and future CSES Module 3 Advance Releases
to be helpful in their work.

===========================================================================
))) CSES PROJECT PROFILE
===========================================================================

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) is a collaborative
program of research among election study teams from around the world.
Participating countries include a common module of survey questions
in their post-election studies.  The resulting data are deposited along
with voting, demographic, district and macro variables. The studies are
then merged into a single, free, public dataset for use in comparative
study and cross-level analysis.

The research agenda, questionnaires, and study design are developed by
an international committee of leading scholars of electoral politics and
political science. The design is implemented in each country by their
foremost social scientists.

By collaborating in this way, the CSES community hopes to forward
scientific inquiry into the relationship between electoral
institutions and political behavior.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES MODULE 3 STUDY DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES Module 3 is scheduled to be in use from 2006 through 2011. It is 
based on the stimulus paper by Hermann Schmitt and Bernhard Wessels titled 
"Meaningful Choices: Under what conditions do general elections provide a 
meaningful choice set, and what happens if they don't?"  

The Module focuses on voters' perceptions of, assessments of, and responses
to the variety and quality of political choices in an election. It 
considers several aspects of voter perceptions of the choices they are 
offered. The first involves retrospective evaluations of candidates and 
parties. Second, the module incorporates ideology, party image, and policy 
differences between parties as bases for prospective evaluations. Third, 
the module incorporates respondents' summary perceptions of their own 
political choices. The module also provides instrumentation to address the
potential consequences of political choice sets of varying quality.
(excerpted from Burns and McAllister, 2008)

The CSES project is extremely grateful to our Module 3 collaborators, who
raised their own funds to include CSES Module 3 in a nationally
representative post-election study in their country or province.

Listed collaborators are our contact persons for election studies that
appear in the CSES Module 3 full release dataset - they are not necessarily
the parties who collected the data.  Most election studies benefitted from
the scientific input and data preparation skills of additional persons
not listed here.

Within each election study, collaborators are presented in alphabetical
order. The affiliations listed are current as of the date when each
election study's Design Report was deposited with CSES.

>>> CSES MODULE 3 SECRETARIAT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the CSES project and its governance are international in nature, the
CSES Secretariat for CSES Module 3 was a cooperation between two 
organizations: the Center for Political Studies, Institute for Social 
Research, University of Michigan, United States; and GESIS - Leibniz 
Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany.

Support was received from various sources for the activities of the CSES 
Secretariat during the period of CSES Module 3:

1. American National Science Foundation (NSF) grant SES-0451598, "The 
Comparative Study of Electoral Systems" with Principal Investigators Nancy 
Burns (University of Michigan), Donald Kinder (University of Michigan), and
Ian McAllister (Australian National University), provided support for the 
entire CSES Secretariat from the beginning of CSES Module 3 through 2008.

2. American National Science Foundation (NSF) grant SES-0817701, "The 
Dynamics of Political Choice: the Third Module of the Comparative Study of
Electoral Systems (CSES)" with Principal Investigators Nancy Burns 
(University of Michigan) and Ian McAllister (Australian National 
University), supported the CSES Secretariat activities at the University
of Michigan beginning in 2008.

3. The work by the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences was 
funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and 
governments of several German Länder. 

4. The University of Michigan provided additional financial support.

Professor Ian McAllister of the University of Minnesota, and chair of the 
CSES Module 3 Planning Committee, oversaw operations of the CSES 
Secretariat through 2009. Professor André Blais of the University of
Montreal and chair of the CSES Module 4 Planning Committee, was
responsible for oversight of operations through the remainder of CSES 
Module 3.

Various persons staffed the CSES Secretariat throughout the Module 3
period. David Howell served as the Director of Studies. Matias Bargsted,
Kathrin Busch, Jessica Fortin, Sebastian Netscher, Bojan Todosijevic,
and Jill Wittrock provided research support, documentation, and data
preparation services. Laurie Winslow served as project administrator. 
Ryan Burton provided information technology support.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MICRO-LEVEL (SURVEY) COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES module is intended to be administered as a single, uninterrupted 
block of questions at the beginning or the end of a national election 
survey. There are several features of this component of which analysts 
should be aware:

A. The question text is included in the variable documentation of this
codebook. The questions are reported in the order in which they appear in
the CSES questionnaire.

B. Where there are known differences in the way a particular question was
administered in an election study, this is noted in the "Election Study
Notes" following the documentation of the corresponding variable.

C. There are several sets of party and leader evaluation items included
in the module.  These correspond to parties labeled A-F, in descending
order of vote share, of the six most popular parties in the lower house
elections (or presidential elections if legislative elections were not
held). Where respondents were asked to evaluate other parties, these
evaluations have been included where possible and are labeled parties
G-I, regardless of their vote shares. The parties and leaders to which
these evaluations apply are identified in Appendix I.

D. There are several questions (including the vote-choice and party
identification items) that ask the respondents to specify a political
party.  The codes for these items are also reported in Appendix I.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DISTRICT-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The district-level variables report the returns of the lower house (first
segment) election for each respondent's district. Wherever possible,
these data were collected from official electoral commissions (see
Bibliography for details). In other cases, CSES has been grateful for the
compilations of these data provided by projects like "Political
Transformation and the Electoral Process in Post-Communist Europe" project
election database (www.essex.ac.uk/elections/). 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MACRO-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To supplement the micro (survey) data, the teams of researchers responsible
for the collection of the public opinion data also compiled and deposited 
the following types of data:  electoral legislation, political party 
platforms, and official electoral returns.

To facilitate this process, a detailed questionnaire was constructed to 
serve as a framework for the macro component of the project. The Macro Data
Reports, completed by the CSES collaborators, can be found on the CSES
website in the Module 3 section under "Download Data".

Additional measures thought pertinent to the micro-district-macro design
are also compiled and available in the CSES data files.

A bibliography of the sources consulted during the compilation of macro
data follows the main body of these introductory materials.


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO USE THE CSES MODULE 3 DOCUMENTATION
===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several components to the CSES documentation. Analysts will 
want to become familiar with all of them.

For most election studies, collaborators have provided documentation
to accompany their election studies. These documents, where available,
can be found on the CSES Module 3 download page under "Data Center" on
the CSES website (www.cses.org).

The CSES Module 3 questionnaire is also available from the website or
by referencing the corresponding variables in this codebook.

The codebook consists of three files:

"CSES3_codebook_part1_introduction.txt" is the codebook introduction, the 
file you are reading now; it includes an overview of the study and data, 
information about use of the files, general election study descriptions 
and notes, and a bibliography

"CSES3_codebook_part2_variables.txt" is the variable descriptions' file, 
including questions, code frames, general notes, and notes specific to 
an election study (by variable)

"CSES3_codebook_part3_appendices.txt" contains Appendix I (Parties and 
Leaders) and Appendix II (Primary Electoral Districts)

Analysts will also want to become familiar with the CSES Module 3 errata
page. It is accessible from the CSES Module 3 download page under "Data 
Center" on the CSES website. Information, updates, and error notifications
and corrections are posted there, in real time, as they become available.
Please check regularly for errata notifications to keep up to date.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the CSES Module 3 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "C".
This convention helps reduce the possibility of overwriting data when
merging with other CSES data sets.

Variables are presented in five groupings:

C1001-C1999 Identification, weight, and election study variables
C2001-C2999 Demographic variables
C3001-C3999 Micro-level (survey) data (the CSES Module 3 questionnaire)
C4001-C4999 District-level data
C5001-C5999 Macro-level data

In the Variable Descriptions portion of the codebook, the headers for
individual variables are surrounded by two lines of dashes.  Variable 
names do not exceed eight characters in length.

Most sections of the codebook can be navigated in the electronic
files by searching for the characters ">>>" or ")))" as appropriate.


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO USE THE CSES MODULE 3 DATA FILES
===========================================================================

The CSES Module 3 data files are distributed in a single ZIP file named
"cses3.zip".  We recommend that users download this file to their
local computer in a directory named:

c:/cses/module3/20110331/

The last portion of the directory name ("20110331") indicates the version
of the dataset (2011, March 31).  This arrangement allows the distributed
files to run without modification, and also sets your files up in a 
way that is well-organized for future distributions of CSES data files.

Within "cses3.zip" are eight (8) files:

"cses3_codebook_part1_introduction.txt" is the codebook introduction file
"cses3_codebook_part2_variables.txt" is the variable descriptions' file
"cses3_codebook_part3_appendices.txt" is the codebook appendices' file
"cses3_rawdata.txt" is the raw data file
"readme.txt" is a readme file with information similar to here
"sas.zip" contains statements for reading the data into SAS
"spss.zip" contains statements for reading the data into SPSS
"stata.zip" contains statements for reading the data into STATA

You only need to unzip files for the statistical package you wish to
use (SAS, SPSS, or STATA). If you wish to use none of the three, the
"cses3_rawdata.txt" file is stored with a header statement and delimiters
(commas) so that you may read it into a software package of your choice.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> USING CSES MODULE 3 IN SAS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the "sas.zip" file are five (5) files:

"cses3_codelabels.sas"     contains code labels
"cses3_columns.sas"        contains column locations
"cses3_formats.sas"        contains format statements
"cses3_variablelabels.sas" contains variable labels
"cses3_run.sas"            is the file you execute to generate a SAS 
                           system file

You need only read into SAS the syntax file "cses3_run.sas". 
If you downloaded the files to the recommended subdirectory, you 
should be able to execute the file as is and a SAS system file 
will be created in the same subdirectory.

The file "cses3_run.sas" refers to the other files above in the body 
of the file - if you wish to exclude any of the other files from running
on your data set (for instance, perhaps you do not wish to have code
labels appear) you may comment out or delete the reference from the
"cses3_run.sas" file.

If you are storing any of the files in an alternate location (including
the data file "cses3_rawdata.txt"), or you want to store the resulting 
SAS system file under a different name or location, you will want to 
modify the SAS files accordingly.

Additional instructions are found in the "cses3_run.sas" file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> USING CSES MODULE 3 IN SPSS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the "spss.zip" file are five (5) files:

"cses3_codelabels.sps"     contains code labels
"cses3_columns.sps"        contains column locations and variable labels
"cses3_formats.sps"        contains formats
"cses3_variablelabels.sps" contains variable labels
"cses3_run.sps"            is the file you execute to generate an SPSS 
                           system file

You only need to read into SPSS the syntax file "cses3_run.sps". 
If you downloaded the files to the recommended subdirectory, you 
should be able to execute the file as is and a SPSS system file 
will be created in the same subdirectory.

The file "cses3_run.sps" refers to the other files above in the body 
of the file - if you wish to exclude any of the other files from running
on your data set (for instance, perhaps you do not wish to have code
labels appear) you may comment out or delete the reference from the
"cses3_run.sps" file.

If you are storing any of the files in an alternate location (including
the data file "cses3_rawdata.txt"), or you want to store the resulting 
SPSS system file under a different name or location, you will want to 
modify the SPSS files accordingly.

Additional instructions are found in the "cses3_run.sps" file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> USING CSES MODULE 3 IN STATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the "stata.zip" file are five (5) files:

"cses3_codelabels.do"     contains code labels
"cses3_columns.dct"       contains column locations
"cses3_formats.do"        contains format statements
"cses3_variablelabels.do" contains variable labels
"cses3_run.do"            is the file you execute to generate a STATA 
                          system file

You only need to read into STATA the syntax file "cses3_run.do". 
If you downloaded the files to the recommended subdirectory, you 
should be able to execute the file as is and a STATA system file 
will be created in the same subdirectory.

The file "cses3_run.do" refers to the other files above in the body 
of the file - if you wish to exclude any of the other files from running
on your data set (for instance, perhaps you do not wish to have code
labels appear) you may comment out or delete the reference from the
"cses3_run.do" file.

If you are storing any of the files in an alternate location (including
the data file "cses3_rawdata.txt"), or you want to store the resulting 
STATA system file under a different name or location, you will want to 
modify the STATA files accordingly.

Additional instructions are found in the "cses3_run.do" file.


===========================================================================
))) SPECIAL DATA NOTES
===========================================================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> IDENTIFICATION VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each record in CSES Module 3 contains two key identification variables.

The first is ELECTION STUDY, which uniquely identifies an election study
across time. It appears in two variations:

    C1003 "ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (NUMERIC POLITY)"
    C1004 "ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (ALPHABETIC POLITY)"

The second is RESPONDENT, which uniquely identifies a respondent across
time:

    C1005 "ID VARIABLE - RESPONDENT"

Notes on their creation and use are available in the variable descriptions
portion of the codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MISSING DATA

(1) Researchers should be aware that sometimes there are multiple response
categories included in the code "missing" (the code "missing" is usually
indicated with a last digit of 9).  For some election studies in which we
could not distinguish among various answers, the code "missing"
may include cases where respondents refused to answer the question,
"don't know" responses, and cases where there a particular question went
unanswered for other reasons.

(2) While CSES guidelines request that the response categories "Refused"
and "Don't Know" be volunteered responses, this was not always consistently
applied.  For instance, sometimes the options were offered explicitly to
respondents in mail-back surveys, which do not have the benefit of an
interviewer being present.  To identify whether the response options were
volunteered (or not) in a particular election study, please refer to the
original questionnaire provided by the collaborator.  The original
questionnaires, where available, are accessible from the CSES Module 3
download page under "Data Center" on the CSES website.

>>> WEIGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the variance in the sample designs used in the election studies
included in this project, the weights provided by the collaborators also
vary greatly.  They are described in detail in variables C1010-C1014.
Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
that their analyses are weighted appropriately.

This advance release of CSES Module 3 includes only the original weights
provided by the collaborators, where available:

    C1010_1  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    C1010_2  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    C1010_3  >>> ORIGINAL WEIGHT: POLITICAL

The remainder of the weight variables in the dataset will be constructed
from the original weights; however, the additional weight variables will
not be made available until the Full Release of the CSES Module 3 dataset:

    C1011_1  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF SAMPLE WEIGHT
    C1011_2  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT
    C1011_3  >>> FACTOR: MEAN OF POLITICAL WEIGHT
    C1012_1  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: SAMPLE
    C1012_2  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: DEMOGRAPHIC
    C1012_3  >>> POLITY WEIGHT: POLITICAL
    C1013    >>> FACTOR: SAMPLE SIZE ADJUSTMENT

>>> FREEDOM STATUS OF ELECTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of studies that comprise CSES are collected in countries that
have free or partly free elections. However, sometimes a collaborator will
include the CSES module in a study of a country that is a developing
democracy or that is considered not free. If the data collection is judged
to be of sufficiently high quality, the study is included in CSES datasets
even if the country is considered to be not free. The decision is left to
individual users as to whether such countries should be included in their
analyses of CSES datasets.

The CSES Module 3 dataset includes freedom ratings from Freedom House, 
whose website as of this dataset release is: http://www.freedomhouse.org/

Freedom House is not affiliated with the CSES project.

The following section provides:

(1) General information about the election after which the CSES Module 3 
was administered. In several cases, the election followed the establishment
of new electoral rules. In several others, the election marks a dramatic
change in government.  This information is provided with the intention of
alerting the analyst to interesting features of the election. For more
details, please refer to the Macro Reports prepared by the collaborators,
available on the CSES website.

(2) General information about the research and sample designs of the
component election studies. For example, in some cases, the CSES module was
administered in a later wave of a multi-wave study.  Additionally, in
several countries, portions of the population were excluded from the sample
frame, usually because of geographic isolation.

(3) Additional information on survey weights, where available, is provided
for some election studies.

Please note that the number of "Election Summaries" will not match the
number of election studies, because sometimes multiple election studies are
conducted concerning a single election.  Where multiple election studies 
are conducted concerning a single election, they are grouped under a single 
header.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "On 14 October 2007, Prime Minister John Howard called elections for 24 
November. At stake were all 150 seats in the House of Representatives, and 
40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. 

Prime Minister Howard (Liberal Party) was seeking a fifth consecutive term 
in office. In the previous elections held on 9 October 2004, his party 
won 74 seats in the House of Representatives, promising to maintain low 
interest rates for further economic prosperity. He formed a coalition 
government comprising the Liberal Party, the National's (12 seats) and the 
Country Liberal Party (one seat). His main rival was Mr. Kevin Rudd of the 
centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP). A former diplomat, Mr. Rudd was 
elected as party leader on 4 December 2006. The ALP, which had won 60 seats
in 2004, was seeking a return to power after 11 years in the opposition. 

In all, 1,421 candidates ran for the elections. 13 candidates vied for the 
seat in the Bennelong electorate in Sydney held by Prime Minister Howard. 
The 2007 elections saw once again a duel between the Liberal Party and the 
ALP. 

Prime Minister Howard urged voters to support his party for further
economic growth. He argued that an ALP government would wreck the economy.
The 68-year old leader said that if his party won the elections, he would
hand over leadership mid-term to the treasurer, Mr. Peter Costello. The
50-year old Mr. Rudd, who campaigned under the slogan of "new leadership",
promised to change labour laws, arguing that many workers had not benefited
from economic growth. 

The Liberal leader insisted that the country should maintain its 1,500 
troops in Iraq and 1,000 in Afghanistan as long as needed, and maintain a 
close alliance with the U.S. The ALP leader argued that 550 combat troops 
should be withdrawn from Iraq by mid-2008, while more troops should be sent 
to Afghanistan. He also pledged to shut down Australia's offshore refugee 
processing and detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. 

Prime Minister Howard continued to oppose the Kyoto Protocol on climate 
change and its carbon emission targets, arguing they would damage the 
country's economy. Mr. Rudd promised to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and 
pledged to cut carbon emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. In 2007, Australia 
suffered its worst drought in 100 years. Global warming was reportedly a 
major concern for many citizens. 

During the election campaign, the Liberal Party was damaged by two 
incidents. On 7 November, the Reserve Bank raised interest rates to 6.75
per cent, the sixth increase since the 2004 elections, when Prime Minister 
Howard had promised to keep the interest rate low. Two days before the 
polling day, further controversy was caused by leaflets circulated in 
Sydney by volunteers and members of the Liberal Party, which linked the ALP
to  Muslim extremists. The Prime Minister condemned the act and emphasized
he  had not authorized the leaflets. 

The final results gave a major victory to the ALP, which won 83 seats in 
the House of Representatives, while the Liberal Party took 55. 
A well-known former television journalist, Ms. Maxine McKew (ALP) narrowly 
defeated Prime Minister Howard, who had held his Bennelong seat since 1974. 
He became the first incumbent prime minister to be voted out since Mr. 
Stanley Bruce in 1929. 

In the Senate elections, the ALP won 18 seats, controlling 32 seats in all. 
The Liberal Party won 15 seats and also holds 32 seats in all. Newly-
elected Senators are due to take up their posts on 1 July 2008. Until then 
the Liberal Party remains the largest party and retains its one seat 
majority in the Senate. 

On 3 December, Mr. Rudd was officially sworn in as Prime Minister, alongside 
Deputy Prime Minister Ms. Julia Gillard, who became the first woman to hold 
the post. Mr. Rudd's first act was to sign Australia's ratification of the 
Kyoto Protocol."

(2) The CSES Module was included in the Australian Post-Election Study, 
running from November 23, 2007 until March 14, 2008 as a self-completion 
supplement by mail. Because of this chosen mode of survey, interviewers 
were not employed. The sample of the survey was restricted to persons 
aged 18 or older being registered as voters. No social group such as 
institutionalized persons and military personnel were excluded from 
sampling. The sampling procedure itself was a stratified systematic 
random sampling. Electors were drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll 
by the Australian Electoral Commission, following the close of rolls for 
the 2007 election. The sample was selected to be proportional to the 
population, on a state by state basis. The entire electorate was randomly 
selected, therefore involving no further stages of selection, or any kind
of stratification, clustering or quota sampling. On average, selected 
persons have been contacted three times. 

(3) The original data, provided by Australia, did not include any kind of
weights. Furthermore, due to the sample procedure, weights were not 
necessary to make the sample representative for the whole Australian 
population.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - AUSTRIA (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Elections were held on 28 September 2008 for all the seats in the 
National Council following premature dissolution of this body on 9 July 
2008. Elections to the National Council had previously taken place on 1 
October, 2006.

The collapse of the coalition government in July 2008 triggered early
elections to the 183-member National Council in September, nearly 25 
months before they were due. Following the previous elections in October 
2006, three months of negotiations resulted in a grand coalition between 
the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ, 68 seats) and the People's Party (ÖVP, 66
seats). SPÖ leader, Mr. Alfred Gusenbauer, was sworn in as Prime Minister 
in January 2007. However, the coalition government remained fragile due to
its different political views, in particular regarding health, taxes, 
pensions and education. 

The country of 8.2 million inhabitants had enjoyed high economic growth
(3.4 per cent in 2007) and a low unemployment rate of 4 per cent. 
Inflation and high fuel prices reportedly disrupted the country's economy
prior to the 2008 elections. In June, Prime Minister Gusenbauer announced
that he would step down as SPÖ leader. On 7 July, ÖVP leader, Mr. Wilhelm
Molterer, announced that his party would withdraw from the coalition 
government. The two parties had been in disagreement over tax reform 
as well as a SPÖ proposal to offset inflation. Mr. Molterer criticized
the SPÖ for being "without orientation or leadership". On 9 July, the 
National Council voted unanimously to dissolve itself with a view to 
holding elections. The Government, in consultation with the Main Committee
of the National Council, set the election date for 28 September. 

Following a reform of the electoral law in 2007, the voting age was 
lowered from 18 to 16 years, and people over 18 years of age (instead
of 19) became eligible to run for elections to the National Council. 
In the same vein, the term of the National Council was extended from four
to five years starting from the new legislature. 

As many as 15 parties fielded candidates in the 2008 elections. 
Transport Minister, Mr. Werner Faymann, led the SPÖ which repeated its
long-standing policy of making the last year of kindergarten compulsory
and free of charge. The ÖVP, which had opposed that policy in the outgoing
legislature, announced that it would support the SPÖ's plan. The 
pre-election polls suggested that neither the SPÖ nor the ÖVP would obtain
a majority in the new National Council. 

Two far-right parties featured prominently during the election campaign.
The Freedom Party (FPÖ, which took 21 seats in the 2006 elections) of Mr.
Heinz-Christian Strache and the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ),
formed in April 2005 by former FPÖ leader Mr. Jörg Haider, both campaigned
to end immigration and called for the expulsion of foreigners and 
asylum-seekers who committed crimes. During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Strache
criticized the outgoing coalition government, calling its members 
"traitors of the people". Mr. Haider promised to fight off the 
"catastrophe of inflation" and provide rent subsidies and free 
kindergarten. 

The ÖVP promised to fight abuses of asylum rules. The Greens of Mr. 
Alexander Van der Bellen proposed that all children born to parents 
who were legal residents in Austria should be granted Austrian citizenship.

The media focused on discussion about a post-election coalition. SPÖ 
leader Faymann firmly rejected the possibility of forming a coalition 
government with either of the far-right parties. He said he preferred 
another coalition with the ÖVP, arguing that a broad consensus would be 
needed to tackle the economic downturn, health care and educational reform.
ÖVP leader Molterer did not explicitly rule out the possibility of a 
coalition with the far-right parties. The Greens were open to coalition 
with the SPÖ or the ÖVP but dismissed any possibility of a coalition with 
the FPÖ and the BZÖ. 

A total of 78.81 per cent of the 6.3 million registered voters turned out
at the polls. 

Both the SPÖ and the ÖVP recorded their worst results since World War II.
They won 57 and 51 seats respectively. On the contrary, the FPÖ and the
BZÖ increased their strength to 34 and 21 seats respectively. The Greens
took the remaining 20 seats. In all 50 women were elected. 

On 8 October, President Heinz Fischer (SPÖ) asked Mr. Faymann (SPÖ) to 
form a new government. The newly elected National Council held its first 
session on 28 October and re-elected Ms. Barbara Prammer (SPÖ) as its 
Speaker. On 2 December, Mr. Faymann's government comprising the SPÖ and the
ÖVP was sworn in by President Fischer.

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of the Austrian Population, 
persons aged 17 and older, all persons eligible to vote for the national
election 2008. 

The sample was drawn using multiple stratification with a clustered 
address random procedure:
a. Austria was divided into nine provinces proportional to their 
population (age 17 and above)
b. These provinces were then divided in 121 administrative districts, 
again proportional to their population,
c. These districts were finally divided in 9 different town sizes.
d. Communities were then randomly selected, and within each community a 
PAC (post-certified address code) and then 5 addresses, again randomly.
e. The Kish Method was used to reach younger people in each household.

The sampling frame for stratification is based on census data provided by
Statistics Austria; the selection of households is based on the Austrian
telephone book (Österreichische Post AG).
Every interviewer was given a second address in case the target respondent
was not contactable or the address was not correct. Only then could the 
second address be used. A postcard was sent to potential respondents prior
to the study.

Note that although the survey organization had been requested 
to interview only Austrian citizens who are eligible to vote, some 38 
non-citizens were first included in the sample. All of those have been
removed from the final sample.

(3) A demographic sample weight is included that adjusts sample 
characteristics to those of the population. The sample selection procedure
was designed to ensure random sampling at the last stage. Because of non-
response the sample is not an exact representation in terms of equal 
distribution of the known demographic characteristics of the Austrian 
population. Hence weights are used to adapt to those known distributions.

The weighting was computed as follows.
Gender x province
Gender x age
Gender x occupation
Gender x education
Gender x province x town size

Note that the weight variable was not recalculated after the removal of
those 38 non-naturalized immigrant respondents who had been sampled only 
by mistake, also see above.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - BELARUS (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 24 June 2008, President Alexander Lukashenko issued a presidential 
decree calling elections to the House of Representatives on 28 September.
In the previous elections, held in October 2004, 96 nominally independent
candidates were elected, with the remainder representing pro-presidential
political parties. None of the 104 candidates from the opposition Popular
Coalition Five Plus (see note) were elected. A total of 263 candidates and
eight parties contested the 2008 elections. 

Four pro-presidential parties backed a total of 24 candidates: the
Communist Party of Belarus (15 candidates), the Liberal Democratic Party
(seven), the Republican Party of Labour and Justice (one) and the 
Belarussian Agrarian Party (one). Other pro-presidential candidates ran as
independents. The United Democratic Force, the opposition coalition formed
during the 2006 presidential elections, remained the main opposition force
in 2008. It fielded 75 candidates. The coalition included the United Civic
Party (UCP, 13 candidates) of Mr. Anatoly Lebedko, the Belarussian 
People's Front (BPF) Revival Party, Mr. Sergei Kalyakin's Party of 
Communists of Belarus (PCB, nine candidates), and the Belarussian Social
Democratic Party (Hramada, eight candidates), led by Mr. Anatoly Levkovich
since August 2008. In the same month, former Hramada leader, Mr. Alexander
Kozulin who had been sentenced to five and a half years' imprisonment in
2006 after staging a protest against President Lukashenko was released 
from prison. In mid August, five UCP candidates in the capital Minsk 
announced that they would withdraw from the elections, citing obstacles 
encountered in their campaigning. On 30 August, the BPF, which had seen 
the candidatures of its two deputy chairmen rejected, announced that the 
party would withdraw all its candidates before polling day, criticizing 
the "undemocratic nature" of the elections. The government stated that the
electoral process was 'open and transparent'. The candidature of the 
leader of an unregistered opposition coalition, the European Coalition,
Mr. Mikalay Statkevich, was rejected in a Supreme Court ruling of 9 
September due to a previous conviction for unauthorized demonstrations
against the results of the 2004 parliamentary elections. 

A total of 76.74 per cent of the 7 million registered voters turned out at
the polls. 

The Organisation for Security and Co operation in Europe (OSCE) and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) sent 465 and 368 observers 
respectively to monitor the polls. The OSCE declared that the elections
fell short of OSCE commitments for democratic elections. However, it noted 
some improvements such as the slightly increased access of opposition 
representatives to election commissions and the decision to allow fairer
access for all candidates to prime time television..It nevertheless 
criticized a "barely visible election campaign", which it deemed to be 
strictly controlled by the government. The CIS and the Central Election
Commission said the elections had been "free and open". 

Final results gave six seats to the Communist Party and one to the Agrarian
Party. In all, 30 outgoing members were returned. Other elected candidates 
included 32 managers of State owned companies and institutions, and 17
State officials. No opposition members were elected. The UCP rejected the
election results. The newly elected House of Representatives held its first
session on 27 October and elected Mr. Vladimir Andreichenko as its new
Speaker. Mr. Boris Batura was elected as the new President of the Council 
of the Republic on 31 October. Indirect elections for this chamber had 
taken place between 3 and 10 October."

(2) The CSES module was implemented between February 2 2009 and February
24 2009, following the September 28 legislative elections. The mode of 
interview was face to face. The sample frame covered the totality of the
population of the Republic of Belarus 18 years or older and did not exclude
non-citizens, non-registered voters, institutionalized people or military
personnel. The exact percentage of eligible population excluded from the
sample frame is not available. Multi-stage stratified sampling was used in
the research. The territorial principle of the sample design underlies the 
choice, in accordance with which the selection is realized through a number
of stages (5 in total). At every stage different territorial units are
used: larger ones - at the initial stage; the observation unit corresponds
to the selection unit. At the first stage the stratification of the primary
selection units was realized across all the six administrative territorial
district of the Republic of Belarus. Urban settlements are grouped
according to the number of dwellers, 4 strata were formed. Rural
settlements are grouped according to the regions of each administrative
district of the country. Settlements for the survey were selected by
probability, proportional to the number of people residing there. In total 
60 settlements were included into the sample. At the second stage a method
of random sampling without replacement was applied to select the streets in
the settlements. At further stages the route modeling method was used to
perform the selection. At the third stage, the unit of selection is the 
house, then at the fourth stage, the unit of selection is the household. At
the final stage of the respondent selection the method of the «closest 
birth date» was applied and a single respondent was selected. Urban 
settlements and rural administrative districts were used as primary 
sampling units (PSU), and these were selected by means of random sampling
without replacement. The sample design did not involve clustering at any
stage, or quota sampling. Substitution was permitted if the respondent who
got into the sample refused to take part in the interview, or if after 
three visits the respondent was not reached. The response rate was 50,5%.
The sample contains 2494 households for 1000 valid interviews.

(3) There is no weight variable in this election study given that weights
are not necessary to make the population under study representative of 
the general population of Belarus.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - BRAZIL (2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "On 1 October 2006, parliamentary elections were held for all 513 seats
in the Chamber of Deputies and for 27 seats in the Senate, concurrently 
with presidential elections. 

At the last elections in October 2002, no single party won a majority in
either chamber. The leftist Workers' Party (PT) became the largest party in
the Chamber of Deputies, closely followed by the Liberal Front Party (PFL),
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and the Brazilian Social
Democratic Party (PSDB). 

The 2002 presidential elections were won by Mr. Luiz Inácio 'Lula' da Silva
(PT). A broad alliance of political parties was formed in support of the
government's programme, although the composition of this alliance varied
during the legislature. In June 2005, the government was weakened by
corruption scandals involving campaign donations by the PT to coalition
partners. President da Silva, who had been elected on an anti-corruption
platform, publicly apologized to his fellow citizens in August 2005. 
In the 2006 election campaign, President da Silva argued that his
government had helped millions of poor Brazilians to join the middle class,
and insisted on the necessary co-existence of social and economic policy.
The main opposition parties, the PSDB and the PFL, formed an electoral
coalition. The PSDB camp presented more liberal policies that included the
promotion of free trade agreements, in particular with the United States.
The PFL did not field a presidential candidate, while the PSDB endorsed the
former governor of Sao Paulo, Mr. Geraldo Alckmin, who pledged to enhance
the country's economy by fighting corruption. 

More than 5,000 candidates ran for the Chamber of Deputies, while 220
contested the senatorial seats. About 83 per cent of 125 million voters
turned out at the polls. 

The PMDB became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, winning 89
seats, followed by the PT with 83 and the PSDB with 66 seats. The PFL lost 
33 seats, retaining 65. It nevertheless remained the largest party in the
Senate, winning six seats in the 2006 partial elections, to control 18 
seats in total. 

President da Silva was re-elected with more than 60 per cent of the votes 
in a run-off election on 29 October. On 30 November, the PMDB leader, Mr. 
José  Renan Vasconcelos Calheiros, announced that his party would support 
the President in his second term. President da Silva was sworn in for a 
second term on 2 January 2007. 

The newly elected Congress held its first session on 1 February 2007 and
elected Mr. Arlindo Chignalia Júnior (PT) as Speaker of the Chamber of
Deputies, while Mr. José Renan Vasconcelos Calheiros (PMDB) was re-elected
as Speaker of the Senate."

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey 
between December 17, 2006 and December 27, 2006. The questionnaire was 
translated in Portuguese by the national survey team. The sample includes
persons aged 16 or older with Brazilian citizenship. The study employs a 
three stage stratified probability sample of Brazilian adults. In the first
stage, 79 primary sampling units (PSU), or municipios, were selected with 
probability proportional to size (PPS). In the second stage, 100 secondary 
units (census tracts) were selected PPS within each of the PSUs. In the 
third stage, the households were selected within census tracts with one 
adult respondent being selected by quota by age, sex, education level, 
working/not working population, according to 2003 PNAD (IBGE). 

Note that the electoral districts in Brazil overlap with state
boundaries, with the exception of one: the Federal District. For 
procedural reasons, five electoral districts in the region North 
(Acre, Amapa, Rondonia, Roraima) and Center (Tocantins) were left
out of the data sampling procedure. According to the National
Household Survey PNAD2003 these 5 states represent 2% of the
population.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - CROATIA (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "On 12 October 2007, the parliament voted to dissolve itself in view of 
elections due in November 2007. President Stjepan Mesic subsequently called 
elections for 25 November. 

In the previous elections held in November 2003, the pro-western Croatian 
Democratic Union (HDZ) won 66 seats. The main opposition party, the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP, former communist party) and its allies (the Libra, 
the Liberal Party, and the Istrian Democratic Party), took 43 seats. The 
Croatian People's Party (HNS) won 11 seats, while the Croatian Party of the 
Right (HSP) and the Zagorje Democratic Party (ZDS) took eight seats each. 
The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), 
and the Primorje Gorski Kotar Alliance (PGS) took nine, three, and one seat 
respectively. The remaining seats went to small parties. 

A total of 3,585 candidates from 251 lists (parties and coalitions) ran for 
the 2007 elections. 

The 2007 elections saw once again a duel between Prime Minister Ivo 
Sanader's HDZ, and the SDP of Mr. Zoran Milanovic. The main issues were 
economic policy and the country's accession to the European Union (EU) and 
NATO. Both parties were favourable to accede to the EU before 2010. While 
the HDZ pledged to accelerate the accession process, the SDP argued the 
conditions of accession were more important than speed. The SDP added that 
accession to NATO should be decided by a referendum. Opinion polls 
indicated that only around 40 per cent of Croatians were favourable to 
membership of NATO. The HSP, led by Mr. Anto Djapic, was the only major 
Eurosceptic party. It argued that Croatia needed to protect its industries,
in particular, agriculture and fisheries. 

Prime Minister Sanader advocated a liberal economy with less state 
involvement. Arguing that the government had created 129,000 jobs, the HDZ 
pledged to continue to support the private sector and stringent fiscal 
measures to achieve a balanced budget by 2010. The SDP insisted on more 
state control over the economy. It promised to lower taxes on businesses, 
while introducing a new tax on stock market gains. The HNS, led by Ms. 
Vesna Pusic, also promoted a liberal economy, and pledged to deal with 
unemployment by providing lifelong education. The Croatian Party of 
Pensioners (HSU) focused on health, welfare, and pensions in a bid to 
attract one million pensioners in the country. It said it would align 
itself with whichever party won the elections. 

The HSS, the HSLS, and the PGS maintained an electoral alliance under the 
name HSS-HSLS Coalition. The Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) fielded 
candidates independently for the first time in its history. Its leader, 
Ivan Jakovcic, argued that the country should not rely on the two major 
parties (HDZ and SDP), and vowed to promote decentralization. The Croatian 
Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB), a breakaway party from
the HDZ, was led by Mr. Branimir Glavas, MP and former military commander. 
He formed the HDSSB in May 2006 but was briefly jailed in October 2006 and 
April 2007 for alleged war crimes in 1991-2. 

The HDZ had strong support from Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina who are 
eligible to vote. The SDP vowed to strip Bosnian Croats of the right to 
vote in Croatian elections if it was elected to office. 

Over 57 per cent of the country's 4.5 million registered voters, including 
400,000 voters abroad, turned out at the polls. Turnout in Croatia was 
recorded at 63.41 per cent. [...] 

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) praised the
elections for being transparently and professionally administered. It 
declared that they "represented further progress in fully meeting OSCE 
commitments for democratic elections". The announcement of the final 
results was delayed due to irregularities in five polling stations, where 
the number of the votes cast exceeded the total number of the voters. 
Elections were repeated on 9 December in those polling stations. Election 
results remained unchanged. 

The final results gave 66 seats to the ruling HDZ. The SDP came in second 
with 56 seats. The HSS-HSLS Coalition won eight seats and the HNS took 
seven. The IDS and the HDSSB won three seats respectively. The HSP and the 
HSU each won one seat. The eight remaining seats were reserved for 
representatives of ethnic minorities (see note). Both the HDZ and SDP 
leaders claimed the right to form a government. 

On 15 December, President Mesic designated outgoing Prime Minister Mr. 
Sanader as the new Prime Minister, stating Mr. Sanader had showed his 
ability to form a coalition. Mr. Sanader subsequently formed a new
coalition government comprising the HDZ, the HSS-HSLS Coalition, the HSU
and representatives of all ethnic minorities. 

The newly-elected parliament held its first session on 11 January 2008 and 
elected Mr. Luka Bebic (HDZ) as its new Speaker. 

On 13 January, the parliament approved Mr. Sanader's new Cabinet. Mr. 
Slobodan Uzelac became the first ethnic Serb to hold the post of Deputy 
Prime Minister (in charge of economic development, reconstruction and the 
return of refugees) since Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia 
in 1991."

(2) The CSES was implemented between March 10, 2008 and April 3, 2008 as a
post-election study in face-to-face interviews. The sample of origin 
included 2060 persons aged 18 years and older living in Croatia.
The selection process was a two-way stratified multistage sampling. 
Stratification was performed by region and settlement size (including four
groups: up to 2.000 inhabitants, 2.001-10.000 inhabitants, 10.001-100.000 
inhabitants, more than 100.000 inhabitants). Within each stratum, 
settlements were chosen with probability proportionate to size, according 
to the size of population, based on Croatian Census data of 2001. That 
implies random selection of settlement with population less than 2000, 
while the largest cities in all regions are mandatory part of the sample. 

The household within the chosen settlements was selected using "random 
starting point method" and "random walk method". Finally, within the 
household the concert respondent was selected using the Troldahl-Carter-
Bryant method. 

The sample selection process excluded institutionalized persons in health 
care and elderly care institutes, in religious organizations and so on. 
Military personnel were excluded as long as they live in military 
barracks, but not if they live in private households. Moreover, people with
visual and hearing disabilities were excluded generally. In total about 
0.7% of the overall population (aged 18 upwards) were not part of the  
sampling frame. The total amount of completed interviews in the sample are 
1004 respondents.

(3) The Croatian data includes two different weights, to control a) for the 
demographic marginal (region, settlement, size, sex, age, education) and b) 
to controls for the political marginal (region, settlement, size, sex, age, 
education) according to the election results. Both weights were 
calculated on the basis of the Croatian Census data of 2001.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - CZECH REPUBLIC (2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 2006 elections were the first parliamentary elections since the 
country's accession to the European Union (EU) in May 2004. 

After the last elections in June 2002 the Czech Social Democratic Party
(CSSD) formed a coalition government with the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czech People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Freedom Union-Democratic 
Union (US-DEU) that controlled 101 seats in the 200-member Chamber of 
Deputies. 
Close to 5,000 candidates and 26 political groups contested the 2006 
elections. The pro-EU CSSD was led by Prime Minister Jiri Paroubek who 
became Prime Minister in April 2005 after Mr. Stanislav Gross stepped 
down over allegations involving his personal finances. The CSSD formed 
an electoral coalition with the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia 
(KSCM) pledging to preserve a welfare state policy by raising pensions 
and the minimum wage while aiming to introduce the euro as the national 
currency in 2010. 

The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) led by Mr. Mirek Topolanek formed 
an electoral coalition with the KDU-CSL and the Greens (SZ). It favoured 
a more liberal economy while taking a more cautious approach to the euro. 
It pledged to introduce a flat 15 per cent rate for income tax and VAT and
to abolish all other taxes. 

Voting went off peacefully. Turnout was recorded at 64.47 per cent higher
than at the 2002 elections with 57.95 per cent. 

The elections ended in political deadlock with both coalitions winning 
exactly 100 seats. The ODS as the largest party with 81 seats was given 
a mandate to form a government. 

The newly-elected Chamber of Deputies held its first session on 27 June. 
However it was adjourned on several occasions due to disputes over the 
election of its new speaker and amid ongoing discussions about the 
formation of a new government. After an agreement was reached between 
the ODS and the CSSD Mr. Miloslav Vlcek (CSSD) was elected as the interim 
Speaker on 14 August paving the way for Prime Minister Paroubek's 
government to resign on 16 August. On the same day President Vaclav Klaus
appointed the ODS leader Mr. Topolanek as the new Prime Minister. 
Mr. Topolanek subsequently formed an ODS-led minority government. 
However on 4 October his government failed to win a parliamentary vote 
of confidence. 

Mr. Topolanek was named Prime Minister for a second time in November 2006.
After months of negotiation on 8 January 2007 he formed a new coalition 
government comprising the ODS the KDU-CSL and the SZ thus controlling 100
seats. On 19 January the abstention of two CSSD parliamentarians enabled 
Mr. Topolanek to win a new vote of confidence by 100 votes to 97 ending 
nearly eight months of political stalemate.

(2) The election study is a post-election study that began on 9th June 2006
and ended on 21th June, 2006. It was conducted face-to-face and was not 
part of a panel study. As a sampling method, quota sampling was used. 
Quotas were designed for each region (14 regions) based on age, sex and 
education, and the size of municipality. If a person refused to take part 
in interview, another person suitable to the quota was selected.

There were around 900 interviewers in the CVVM polling agency all around
the country. They were both men and women almost in the same ratio. Age 
varied in between 18 to 65 years with the average age 38 years. Education
structure of interviewers is 80 % secondary school and 20 % university 
level. The experience with CVVM polling agency varied between 1 to 21 
years. Average interviewer worked for CVVM 12 years.

Before a person becomes an interviewer of CVVM s/he has to go through 
training where principles of interviewing and the administration around 
interviewing (filling the questionnaires, correspondence with public 
opinion headquarters etc.) are learned. After the training, the person 
goes through test interviews. Training of interviewers after becoming an 
interviewer of CVVM is organised every 5 years. There is a training letter
for interviewers added to every questionnaire/survey and almost non-stop 
phone and e-mail consultations.

(3) Since the sample is a quota sample, no weights were needed to make it 
representative of the population.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - FINLAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "The March 2007 elections came on the heels of the country's presidency
of the European Union from July to December 2006. As a result, the election 
campaign started late compared to previous ones. In the last elections held
in March 2003, the Centre Party (KESK) led by Ms. Anneli Jäätteenmäki had 
won 55 seats. She was subsequently elected as the first female prime 
minister of the country and formed a centre-left coalition government with 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) of former prime minister Paavo Lipponen 
(which took 53 seats) and the Swedish People's Party (eight seats). The 
main opposition National Coalition Party (KOK), a moderate conservative
party, took 40 seats, while the remainder of seats was won by small 
parties. In June 2003, Ms. Jäätteenmäki resigned after allegations surfaced
of having illegally obtained confidential documents on the Iraq war, which 
she used in the 2003 election campaign. Mr. Matti Vanhanen (KESK) took over
as Prime Minister. His government enjoyed wide popularity mainly because of
high economic growth, approaching six per cent in 2006, and a 7.7 per cent
unemployment rate, the lowest in 15 years. In the 2007 elections, 1,205 men
and 799 women were vying for the 200 seats in the parliament. 

As in previous elections, employment and taxation were the main issues in 
the 2007 elections. Prime Minister Vanhanen pledged to reduce VAT on food. 
The SDP said the VAT reduction must apply to ordinary goods so as to help 
people with the most modest and average incomes. The KOK, led by a 
36-year-old new leader, Mr. Jyrki Katainen, pledged to cut the income tax 
of people with small and medium incomes. The SDP leader, Mr. Eero 
Heinäluoma, criticized the KESK for campaigning for the establishment of a
"non-socialist" government comprising the KESK and the KOK. 

The Swedish People's Party, representing the Swedish minority in Finland,
promised to reform energy taxes in order to bring about more environment-
friendly policies. The Left Alliance and the Green League hinted at a
possible tax increase to provide better public services. The True Finns,
known for its EU-sceptic policies, also fielded candidates. Only 65.02 per 
cent of the country's 4.2 million registered voters turned out at the 
polls, the lowest post-war figure for general elections. 

The biggest winner in the 2007 elections was the KOK, which gained ten more
seats, winning 50 in all. Former KOK leader Sauli Niinistö was re-elected
with over 60,000 votes or 10 per cent of the party's votes nationwide. The
KESK remained the largest party in the parliament by winning 51 seats,  
although it lost four. The SDP lost eight seats, winning 45, reportedly 
suffering from the low turnout. The SDP lost its position as the country's
second largest party for the first time since 1962. [...]

On 15 April, the KESK, the KOK, the Green League and the Swedish People's 
Party agreed to form a new government. On 17 April, parliament re-elected 
Mr. Matti Vanhanen (KESK) as Prime Minister with 121 votes. His 20-member 
cabinet announced on 19 April included 12 women (60 per cent), a record 
high in the world. On 24 April, Mr. Sauli Niinistö (KOK) was elected as the
new Speaker. 

Note on the "Election Results": 
The statistics above include overseas voting. In all, 208,887 Fins abroad 
were registered to vote. Turnout in Finland was 67.9 % (2,772,799 of the 
4,083,549 registered voters turned out at the polls)."

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey 
between March 20, 2007 and May 20, 2007. The questionnaire was translated
into Finnish and Swedish. The sample was meant to be representative of 
Finnish citizens aged 18 or over living in Finland (excluding the Åland 
Islands, which accounts for 0.48% of the population). There was a 
different sampling procedure for Finnish-speaking Finns and 
Swedish-speaking Finns. For the former, a quota sample was used based on 
gender, age, and province. The interviews were conducted by using the 
random walk method, in which the interviewers made five subsequent 
interviews proceeding from a randomly selected starting point. In cities,
the interviewers were given specific starting addresses, whereas in rural
areas they were allowed to select the starting points by themselves.
For the Swedish-speaking Finns a quota sample was used based on gender,
age, and electoral district, which includes only the districts with a 
significant population of Swedish-speaking Finns, i.e. Helsinki, Uusimaa,
Varsinais-Suomi, and Vaasa. Furthermore, in the selected districts, only 
the municipalities with a significant population of Swedish-speaking Finns
were included in the study. The quotas for the interviews of Swedish-
speaking Finns were formed by ordering an especially large random sample 
from the population register. The sample consisted of enfranchised Swedish-
speaking people in the selected municipalities, and it was ten times larger
than the desired number of respondents.

The original sample contained 1422 respondents which included an oversample
(209 cases) of the Swedish-speaking Finns. In the final dataset, the number
of cases is 1283, of which 5.5 % (71 cases) are Swedish-speaking Finns. 
The oversample was corrected by randomly dropping out 138 Swedish-speaking
Finns. Average response rate was 24.25 % of all the contacted households,  
which includes households where no one was reached, households where no one 
belonged to the target group, and the households where none of the 
respondents matched the available control quotas.

Note that the electoral district Åland was excluded from sampling.

(3) There is no weight variable for this election study.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - FRANCE (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)"The 2007 elections to the National Assembly followed the election as 
President of the Republic of Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, of the Union for a 
Popular Movement (UMP, the ruling centre-right party). In May, Mr. Sarkozy
defeated Ms. Ségolène Royal of the main opposition Socialist Party (PS) in 
a run-off election, and pledged to take the country into a new era, both 
economically and socially. The UMP held 359 seats in the outgoing 
legislature, while the PS had 149.  The June parliamentary elections saw 
once again a duel between the UMP and the PS. President Sarkozy insisted 
that he needed a majority in the National Assembly to carry out his 
presidential programme. Pre-election polls predicted a major victory for 
the UMP. 

The PS argued that the country stood to benefit from a diversity of 
opinion. It was therefore important for the socialist group to be well-
represented in the National Assembly. The centrist Union for French 
Democracy (UDF), whose leader, Mr. François Bayrou had taken 18.5% of the 
vote in the first round of the presidential election, split in two before 
the parliamentary elections. Most of the incumbent UDF members offered 
their support to Mr. Sarkozy in the second round of presidential elections.
In late May, they launched a new party, the "New Centre" party, led by 
Defence Minister, Mr. Hervé Morin. UDF members loyal to Mr. Bayrou formed 
the Union for French Democracy-Democratic Movement (MODEM), which refused 
any electoral alliances with either side of the political divide.  In all 
7,639 candidates contested 577 seats in the National Assembly. 

On 10 June, 60.42 per cent of registered voters turned out at the first 
round of the polls, the lowest figure since 1958. 110 candidates were 
elected in the first round, compared to 58 in the 2002 elections. The UMP 
and its allies took 98 of those 110 seats, securing 39.54 per cent of the 
valid votes while the PS obtained 24.73 per cent of the votes. Twelve women
were elected. 

Fiscal issues took centre stage during the period between the first and 
second rounds. Prime Minister François Fillon came in for scathing 
criticism from the PS over the government's supposed plans to introduce a 
"social VAT" (value-added tax). 

On 17 June, the second round of elections for the remaining 467 seats 
involved candidates who had obtained over 12.5 per cent of the registered 
vote in the first round. Nearly 60 per cent of registered voters turned out
at the polls. The UMP fared less well than opinion polls had predicted. The
Energy and Environment Minister and former prime minister, Alain Juppé 
(UMP) was narrowly defeated and subsequently resigned as minister. The 
final results nevertheless confirmed a clear victory for the UMP, giving it
a total of 313 of the 577 seats. The PS took 186 seats. The New Centre 
party won 20 seats, whereas the MODEM took only three. In all, 107 women 
were elected. 

On 26 June, the newly elected National Assembly held its first session and 
elected Mr. Bernard Accoyer (UMP) as its new Speaker."

(2) The CSES module was implemented between June 18 2007, and July 7 2007 
September 13, 2005 and December 20, 2005, after the elections in telephone 
interviews. The sample consists of 2000 persons aged 18-96 years. The 
sample is selected from the mational metropolitan population over 18, 
registered on electoral lists; overseas territories were excluded from 
target population. Institutionalized people and military personnel were 
included in the sampling frame. Official statistics register 87.6% of 
households as having a phone (only land line phones), which excludes some 
15% of households from the sampling frame. Furthermore unlisted numbers 
were not included, which represents some 16% of households with a land line
phone. It was decided not to include unlisted numbers so that sampling 
frames make it possible to locate precisely households (so that their 
precise vote is recorded). The sampling procedure consists of a stratified
three stage probability sampling. Stratification: Table with 7 ZEAT areas 
and 6 agglomeration classes, i.e. 42 cells. Each cell contains the 
corresponding population size. Stage 1: Allocation of 200 Primary Sampling 
Units (districts)) to the defined cells using Cox Method of controlled 
rounding. Selection of PSUs from the cells according to the allocation 
proportional to population size. Stage 2: Selection of a fixed number (10)
of households from the selected PSUs via a random draw in phone book. 
Stage 3: Selection of an individual within a household via Last-Birthday-
Method. The primary sampling units (PSU) were districts (circonscriptions) 
so that each PSU has an homogenous political offer, selected by the Cox 
Method of controlled rounding (randomly selected). Each unit has been 
randomly drawn through adapted techniques, without clustering, 
substitution, or quota sampling at any stage. Participants did not receive
incentives for their participation. The telephone interviewers (mainly 
student and young educated adults from 20 to 30 -25.4 on average), had, on 
average one year of experience. Interviewer training was conducted in a 
half a day with thorough explanation of sampling strategy and method and 
overview of the questionnaire. Interviewers received special training in 
refusal conversion and reissue of refusals to and other interviewer.

The average contact per household for the entire sample was 8.2 over 15 
days. The response rate was 34.2%. The total number of household in the 
sample was 10469, out of which, 5849 valid households, for a total of 2000 
completed interviews. Weights are necessary to make the sample 
representative for two reasons: a) unequal probabilities of selection, 
especially due to random draw in households of unequal size, and b) a 
posteriori observation of bias on a number of selected variables.

(3) Weights: The French data of origin includes for weights:

C1010_1 (design weight) refers to an unequal probabilities of selection and
is defined as the product of the probability of selection of i-th 
observation in its PSU and the corresponding probability of selecting this 
observation in its household.

C1010_2 corrects for a selections bias bases on gender, age, education, 
occupation and household size. All these variables have been considered in 
their French definition, which do not match international classifications. 
Existence of bias after weighting depends on these various definitions of 
categories.

C1010_3 is due to control for political skewness, computed to correct for a
bias on aggregate electoral results of legislative elections.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - GERMANY (2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "Following his Social Democratic Party's heavy defeat in local 
elections in May 2005, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder orchestrated a negative 
vote of confidence in parliament on 1 July to pave the way for new 
parliamentary elections. He insisted he needed a fresh mandate in order to 
continue his reforms to revive the German economy. On 21 July 2005, 
President Horst Köhler announced the dissolution of the Bundestag and 
called early elections for 18 September 2005, one year ahead of schedule. 
The outgoing government, the Red-Green coalition, was composed of 
Chancellor Schröder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Foreign Minister 
Joschka Fischer's Green Party, which had respectively won 251 and 55 seats 
in the 2002 election. The SPD's main rival, Ms. Angela Merkel's Christian 
Democratic Union (CDU), was supported by the CDU's sister party, the 
Christian Social Union (CSU), standing only in Bavaria. The two had 
respectively won 190 and 58 seats in 2002. The Free Democrats (FDP), 
reported to be a possible coalition partner for the CDU-CSU, held 47 seats. 
Ms. Merkel was aspiring to become the first woman chancellor of the 
country. 

In July 2005, the new Left Party was formed by the Electoral Alternative 
for Work and Social Justice (WASG), a group of left-wing defectors from the
SPD, and the former communist Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), 
consisting predominantly of parliamentarians from eastern Germany, whose 
strength had decreased from 32 seats to 2 in the 2002 election. 
The election campaign focused both on domestic and foreign policy issues. 
Mr. Schröder came to power in 1998 promising to lower the unemployment 
rate. His recent reforms, known as Hartz IV, which aimed to reduce 
unemployment and welfare benefits in order to make the labour market more 
flexible, had reportedly produced little impact and frustrated both the 
unemployed and employers. His rival, Ms. Merkel, argued that a faster pace 
of reform was necessary. Her programmes included a two per cent VAT 
increase to finance a reduction in social security costs for employers. The 
two leaders also held contrasting views over Turkish accession to the 
European Union (EU). While Chancellor Schröder insisted that Turkish 
membership would ensure long-term security in Europe, Ms. Merkel firmly 
opposed Turkey joining the EU and proposed a "privileged partnership" 
instead. 

When the Bundestag was dissolved, the CDU had a 20 point lead over the SPD 
in opinion polls, but the gap had narrowed to 6 points in final surveys 
before polling day. Two major turning points seem to have been the 
televised debate between the two leaders on 4 September and Ms. Merkel's 
appointment of Mr. Paul Kirchof as economic adviser. Mr. Kirchof, known as 
a radical thinker, advocated a simplification of the tax system and, in 
particular, a flat 25 per-cent income tax for all, which reportedly split 
the CDU supporters. His proposals were also criticized by the CSU. 
On 18 September 2005, elections were held in 298 of 299 districts. Of the 
61.6 million registered voters 77.7 per cent turned out at the polls. 
Official results, excluding Dresden, showed that neither the CDU nor the 
SPD had secured enough seats to easily form a ruling coalition. The CDU/CSU 
coalition won 225 seats, followed closely by the SPD with 222 seats. The 
FDP obtained 61 seats, the Greens won 51, and the newly formed Left Party, 
54. 

Voting in the 160th district in Dresden was held separately on 2 October 
due to the death of a candidate. More than 72 per cent of the 219,000 
eligible voters cast their ballots. The CDU won the seat, bringing the 
total seats for the CDU/CSU coalition to 226. 

The newly elected Bundestag was convened on 18 October 2005 and elected Mr. 
Norbert Lammert of the CDU as its speaker. 

On 11 November, after seven weeks of negotiation, the CDU-CSU and the SPD 
agreed to form a grand coalition, the second in German history. Ms. Merkel 
of the CDU was elected as Chancellor on 22 November, becoming the first 
woman to assume the post."

(2) The German data for CSES Module 3 was realized by telephone interviews, 
focusing on the Bundestag elections of September 18, 2005. The interviews 
were conducted by telephone, starting on September 21. The new Laender 
(East Germany) were over-sampled. The survey includes 1014 respondents
from East Germany and 1004 from West Germany. The sample can be analyzed 
either separately for East and West, or, if appropriately weighted, for 
Germany, as a whole. Interviewing period was completed at November 05, 2005 

The sample is a single-stage random household sample. An initial sample was
drawn from the Infratest Telephone Household Master Sample (ITMS), which 
comprises a multi-stratified, largely unclustered sample that is 
distributed in proportion to the number of private households in micro-
cells, thereby compensating for regional or local differences in the 
telephone density of households. The estimated percentage of households 
without a telephone for the whole of Germany is about one percent.  
Institutionalized persons (about four percent) are not included in the 
sample. The existing sample frame covers all listed and unlisted numbers in
Germany. To be interviewed, respondents must be at least 18 years old and 
German citizens. Finally, households were designated non-sample after 12 
unsuccessful callbacks. On average, the interviewer were 27 years old, with
22 month of corresponding experience. Interviewers were trained in two 
seasons, according to the questionnaire and the type of questions, as well
as to dialoguing and argumentation. The response rate of completed 
interviews was 65.6%.

(3) Due to the over-sampling of East Germany, as explained before, the use
of weights is necessary to study the German sample as a whole (weight 
provided). Furthermore a weight is needed to compensate differences in the
distributions of relevant socio-demographic variables in the sample due to
periodical population shifts. According to the federal structure of 
Germany, this weight, based on age groups and sex, corrects for the 
population within each region. Users, employing the original weights 
should take care about the fact that the weight to control the oversampling
of East Germany also controls for the skewness of socio-demographics with 
each of the federal states. Consequently, a combination of both weights is
not necessary.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - GERMANY (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "The 2009 parliamentary elections were held against the backdrop of the
global economic crisis, which severely affected the country's automobile 
industry. In September 2008, the government announced a rescue package 
involving 4.5 billion Euros in loans and credit guarantees. 

In the previous elections to the German Bundestag, which were held in 
September 2005, Ms. Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took 
180 seats. The CDU's sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU, 
standing only in Bavaria) won 46 seats. The CDU/CSU coalition thus took 226
seats in all, slightly more than then Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Social 
Democratic Party (SPD), which won 222 seats. In November, after seven weeks
of negotiation, the CDU/CSU and the SPD agreed to form a grand coalition, 
the second in German history. Ms. Merkel was subsequently elected as 
Chancellor, becoming the first woman in Germany to assume the post. 

The CDU and the SPD disagreed on many issues. In the 2009 elections, 
Chancellor Merkel's CDU sought to win more seats so as to form a new 
coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP). The FDP, led by
Mr. Guido Westerwelle, is known for its pro-business policies based on the
free market economy. It had been a member of the CDU-led coalition 
government between 1982 and 1998. 

In July 2009, the CSU, led by Mr. Horst Seehofer, opposed the country's
ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, aimed at improving the decision-making 
process of the European Union (EU). It argued that the German Parliament 
had to approve EU decisions for them to be binding on Germany. After 
Parliament's approval was obtained on 23 September, President Horst Koehler
signed a law to ratify the Lisbon Treaty. 

Despite the row, however, the CDU announced that it intended to maintain 
its partnership with the CSU after the 2009 elections. The CDU/CSU was 
challenged by Mr. Franz Müntefering's SPD, whose candidate for Chancellor 
was Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. 

The major parties focused on the economy and nuclear energy in the 2009 
election campaign. 

Chancellor Merkel argued that a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition was the only way to 
guarantee economic stability in Germany. The CDU pledged to revive the 
country's economy by creating more jobs and combating unemployment. It also
promised tax cuts and greater investment in education. The FDP promised to 
reduce the State's involvement in economic policy and opposed the 
introduction of a minimum wage proposed by the SPD. The latter vowed to 
introduce a minimum wage of 7.50 euros per hour and to create four million
jobs within the next 10 years. The Green Party opposed the CDU's tax-cut 
plan and promised to introduce a minimum fixed pension for anyone who had 
worked for at least 33 years. It called on voters to prevent the formation
of a CDU-FDP coalition, which, in its view, would allocate less money for 
education and measures to fight global warming. 

In terms of nuclear energy policy, the SPD vowed to stick to plans to 
decommission all German nuclear power stations by 2020, while the CDU and 
the FDP pledged to delay the process and reduce energy prices for 
consumers. 

In June 2007, the Party of Democratic Socialism (the successor to the 
communist party that had ruled East Germany) and the WASG (a group of trade
unionists and former SPD members based in western Germany) had formed the 
Left Party under the leadership of Mr. Oskar Lafontaine, a former SPD 
leader. SPD leader Steinmeier ruled out forming a government with the Left
Party after the 2009 elections and criticized its call for the immediate 
withdrawal of German troops from the NATO mission in Afghanistan. 

An initial opinion poll showed the CDU and the SPD running neck and neck.
The local media reported that overhang seats (see note) would determine the
outcome of the election since the major parties were expected to win most 
of the 299 seats elected from the constituencies (first votes) but would 
not win the same share of seats allocated to parties (second votes). 

In all, 70.78 per cent of the 62 million registered voters turned out at 
the polls. 

The 2009 elections resulted in the creation of a record 24 overhang seats,
up from 16 in the 2005 elections, bringing the total number of seats in the
new legislature to 622. The final results gave 194 seats to the CDU, 14 
more than it had in the 2005 elections. The CSU took 45 seats. The 
CDU/CSU's future coalition partner, the FDP, won 93, up from 61, giving Ms.
Merkel's camp a total of 332 seats. In its worst showing since the end of 
World War II, the SPD lost 76 seats, dropping to 146. Its rival, the Left 
Party, won 76 seats, 22 more than in the outgoing legislature. The Green 
Party took 68, 17 more than in 2005. 

On 27 October, the newly elected German Bundestag held its first session 
and re-elected Mr. Norbert Lammert (CDU) as its Speaker. The following day,
it re-elected Ms. Merkel as Chancellor. Her second government comprised the
CDU/CSU and the FDP."

(2) The German data for CSES Module 3 was conducted as face to face 
interviews, focusing on the Bundestag elections of September 27, 2009. The
interviews were held face to face, for a period running from September 29th
to November 23rd, 2009. The new Laender (East Germany) were over-sampled. 
The survey includes 1569 respondents from West and 526 respondents from 
West Germany. The sample can be analyzed either separately for East and 
West, or, if appropriately weighted, for Germany, as a whole, explained 
in section 3), below.
The sample was applied on the ADM-Design. The ADM-Design is a three-step 
random-design of face to face area sampling, which includes the whole 
populated area of Germany. It is based on a municipality -structure, which
is lodged with data of communal statistics, and with the regional divisions
prepared for the navigation systems. On the base of this data 53,000 areas 
are electronically defined, which include on average 700 private 
households. The Sampling Points and the Households to be interviewed have 
already been extracted, using the Adress-Random-Methode, for the Pre-
Election Study Component of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES)
of the GESIS. The institute extracted by chance twelve households out of 
the remaining addresses and transmitted them to the interviewer. The 
interviewer had to contact all the twelve addresses and should absolve at 
least six interviews within these addresses. The probability of 
interviewing in the post-election study was independent of the pre-election
one. Households were designated as non-sample if they were defined as non-
residential sample point, including vacant housing units, if all members of
the household were ineligible to vote, including language problems, and if
the household was reached after at least five contacts.
To be interviewed, respondents must be at least 16 years old and German 
citizens. Institutionalized persons (about four percent of the eligible 
population) were excluded of the sample frame. However, interviews of 
respondents younger than 18 years had been deleted afterwards. The response
rate of completed interviews was 51.4%, based on the number of valid 
households.

(3) Due to the over-sampling of East Germany, as explained before, the use
of weights is necessary to study the German sample as a whole (weight 
provided). Furthermore a weight is needed to compensate differences in the
distributions of relevant socio-demographic variables in the sample due to
periodical population shifts. According to the federal structure of 
Germany, this weight, based on age groups and sex, corrects for the 
population within each region. Users, employing the original weights should
note that the weight to control the oversampling of East Germany also
controls for the skewness of socio-demographics with each of the 
federal states. Consequently, a combination of both weights is not 
necessary.

(1) Election summary not available for this release. 
For the information about the conduct of the election see: 
http://www.eac.gov.hk/en/legco/2008lce_report1.htm.

(2) The CSES questionnaire was implemented as a single telephone study. The
sample population was defined as registered voters, depending on 
permanently citizens of Hong Kong, aged 18 or older. In contrast, an 
estimated amount of about one percent of the sample population was excluded
due to not having a telephone. The same is true for military persons, who 
are Chinese soldiers and hence no registered voters of Hong Kong. 
The sampling process was a two stage random sample, based on the Hong Kong 
Telephone Directory. In a first stage, the last two digits of each phone 
number were replaced at haphazard. In a second stage, individual 
respondents were randomly selected from all eligible voters within a given
household.

On average, each of the sampled households had been contacted 1.96 times. 
The maximal number of contacts had been five, at different days and day 
times, before a household was defined as non-sample. Moreover, households,
which refused in the first contact, were called a second time at a 
different day.

In total, the sample included 17,504 first stage units, out of which 16,154
were at least of an unknown validity. From the remaining 1,350 households 
another 535 units disappeared due to non-contact, refusals or break-offs 
and partial interviews. All in all, 815 interviews were successfully 
completed, referring to a responds rate of 60.4%, based on the amount of 
valid telephone numbers.

Interviews were held by undergraduate students of the Lingnan University,
who had received basic training in surveying and interviewing. Furthermore,
the interviewers were trained according to basic skills of survey 
interviews and in how to conduct telephone surveys. Finally all of them had
accumulated experiences by participating in other telephone interviews 
prior to the CSES study.

(3) A sample weight is included to correct for skweness in the distribution
age, sex, and the region of residence, according to the sampling process. 
As a benchmark, the "Age and Sex profile of registered electors by 
Legislative Council Constituencies in 2010" has been used, available at 
the website of the Hong Kong Registration and Electoral Office.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ICELAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The 12 May 2007 elections took place amid a heated debate on whether 
the country should prioritize economic growth or the environment, 
crystallized by a proposal to build new dams and aluminum smelters. 

Prime Minister Geir Haarde of the Independence Party (IP) insisted that 
the country should give priority to economic growth by supporting the 
project to build dams and aluminum smelters, fuelled by Iceland's 
geothermal and hydroelectric power resources. 

The IP has dominated Icelandic politics since the country gained 
independence from Denmark in 1944. Since 1995, it has led a coalition 
government with the Progressive Party (PP). The PP, led by Minister of 
Industry and Commerce Jón Sigurdsson, pledged to continue corporate tax
cuts in order to maintain a favorable environment for Icelandic business. 

The main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Alliance led by Ms. 
Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, and the Left-Green Alliance of Mr. 
Steingrímur J. Sigfússon, promised to stop the smelters project until 
appropriate studies on their environmental impact were carried out. 

A new party, the Icelandic Movement, was founded in March 2007 by Mr. 
Ómar Ragnarsson, a former TV reporter and outspoken environmentalist, 
to fight against further heavy industry projects. 

Approximately 83% of the 200,000 registered voters turned out at the polls. 
The final results gave 25 seats to the IP. However, the PP took only 
seven (down from 12 seats in the 2003 elections), giving a majority of just 
one seat to the outgoing coalition. The Social Democratic Alliance 
won 18, losing two; while the Left-Green Alliance gained an extra four 
seats, winning nine in total. The Liberal Party kept its four seats, while
the Icelandic Movement did not win any seats. In all, 20 women were 
elected. 

On 17 May, Prime Minister Haarde and the PP leader Mr. Sigurdsson, 
announced that they would discontinue their coalition following the PP's 
poor election results. Later that same day Mr. Haarde and Mrs. Gísladóttir
announced that the IP and the Social Democratic Alliance had begun 
coalition bargaining. The bargaining resulted in a new cabinet, officially
sworn in on 24 May. 

On 31 May, the newly-elected Parliament held a special summer session, 
which is convened only when elections are held in spring, and elected Mr. 
Sturla Böðvarsson (IP) as its new Speaker.

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of all voters in Iceland. 
Eligible voters are citizens from 18 years onwards. Institutionalized 
persons were excluded from the sample frame. In 2007 they were around 
0.02 % of persons with a permanent residency in Iceland (60 / 307.672).  
The information about the number of prisoners that were Icelandic citizens
comes from the Institute for Icelandic Prisons (i.icelandic; 
Fangelsismálastofnun Íslands). 

The total number, 307,672 is from Statistics Iceland and includes all 
Icelandic citizens and foreign citizens that had residency in Iceland 
on January 1, 2007.
The simple random sample was drawn from the National registry, and 
the primary sampling unit was the individual. SPSS was used to draw a 
random sample from the population. 7.7% of the total eligible population 
were excluded from the sample. These are persons who had requested that 
their name would not be included in any sample drawn from the National 
registry according to information from Statistics Iceland.
Interviews were conducted by telephone. It is estimated that less than 
1% of the populations does not own a phone or mobile phone. According to
the Post and Telecom Administration in Iceland around 96% have a landline.

(3) The data set includes a weight variable (C1010_2) for age, as e.g. 
proportionally fewer in the younger age groups replied to the survey 
compared to the distribution of age in the population according to 
information from Statistics Iceland. 

The weight variable was calculated by dividing the proportion of each 
age according in the population with the proportion of age in the sample. 
An example for the sample of 18 years old respondents: The total number 
of persons in the population at the age of 18 to 80 were 219,875 on 
January 1, 2007. Of them 4,714 were 18 years old (year of birth=1999), 
or 2.1% of the total. In the sample, 1,8% were 18 years old (year of birth
=1999, N=1.595). The weight for 18 years old is therefore 2.1/1.8=1.22

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ICELAND (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The April 2009 elections were held against the backdrop of the global 
financial crisis, which brought down the Government in January 2009. 
They were constitutionally due by May 2011. 

In the previous elections, held in May 2007, then Prime Minister Geir 
Haarde's Independence Party (IP) won 25 seats. The IP has dominated 
Icelandic politics since the country gained independence from Denmark in 
1944. Since 1995, it had led a coalition government with the Progressive 
Party (PP). After the 2007 elections, however, Mr. Haarde formed a new 
coalition government with the Social Democratic Alliance Party (SDA), 
which took 18 seats. 

The nation of 315,000 inhabitants had enjoyed rapid economic growth thanks
to investments in the financial sector. However, the financial crisis that
erupted in the United States in 2008 severely damaged Iceland's economy. 
In October 2008, the country's three main banks collapsed within the space
of a week. The national debt soared to ten times the gross domestic 
product. 

Despite emergency aid of nearly US$ 1.4 billion under the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout plan and an additional loan of US$ 2.5 billion
from its Nordic neighbours (Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden), the 
country's currency, the krona, continued to plummet and unemployment and 
inflation spiralled. The IMF predicted that the economy would shrink by 
9.6 per cent in 2009, the biggest slump since independence. On 24 January
2009, nearly 7,000 citizens protested in front of the parliament building,
demanding that the Prime Minister resign. The Prime Minister tried in vain
to save the situation by proposing early elections in May but ultimately 
announced that he would step down on 26 January. 

On 1 February 2009, a caretaker government was formed by the SDA and the 
Left - Green Movement (LGM). Ms. Johanna Sigurdardottir (SDA) became the
country's first female prime minister. 

On 13 March, President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson issued a decree dissolving 
parliament and calling elections for 25 April. Former Prime Minister 
Haarde announced that he would not run for health reasons. Mr. Bjarni 
Benediktsson, Jr. led the IP in the 2009 elections. 

The main contenders were the SDA, the LGM, the IP, the PP and the Liberal
Party (which took four seats in 2004). Two new parties formed after the 
financial crisis - the Civic Movement (CM) and the Democracy Movement (DC)
- were also vying for seats. 

Although the SDA and the LGM said they would form a new coalition 
government, they disagreed on a key issue, the country's accession to the
European Union (EU). Ms. Sigurdardottir's SDA pledged to join the EU and 
introduce its currency, the euro, in order to save the country's economy.
The LGM, on the other hand, led by Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson,
proposed a currency union with Norway. It pledged to organize a referendum
before the country joins the EU, as did the CM. 

The other parties were also divided over EU membership. The IP argued that
accession would not be in the country's interests because Iceland's 
fisheries would be regulated by the EU, while the PP promised to start
discussions on EU membership. 

In all, 85.10% of some 228,000 registered voters turned out at the polls. 

The SDA came in first with 20 seats; its coalition partner, the LGM, took
14. The IP and the PP took 16 and nine seats respectively. The CM won four
while the LP and the DC failed to win parliamentary representation. 

The number of women increased to 27 (42.86 per cent), up from 20 (31.75 
per cent) in the 2007 elections. The elections also resulted in a high 
turnover of members, with 27 candidates being elected to parliament for 
the first time. 

On 15 May, the newly elected Parliament held its first session and elected
Ms. Ásta R. Jóhannesdóttirof (SDA) as its new Speaker. 

In the meantime, on 11 May, the SDA and the LGM formed a new coalition 
government, thus renewing Ms. Sigurdardottir's premiership. It was the 
first left-wing government in Iceland. For the first time in over six 
decades, the IP did not participate in the government.

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of all voters in Iceland. 
Eligible voters are citizens from 18 years onwards. Institutionalized 
persons were excluded from the sample frame. In 2009 they were around 
0,003 % of persons with a permanent residency in Iceland (80 / 319.368). 
The information about the number of prisoners that were Icelandic citizens
comes from the Institute for Icelandic Prisons (i.icelandic; 
Fangelsismálastofnun Íslands). 

The total number, 319,368 is from Statistics Iceland and includes all 
Icelandic citizens and foreign citizens that had residency in Iceland 
January 1, 2009.
The simple random sample was drawn from the National registry, and
the primary sampling unit was individuals. Excel was used to draw a 
random sample from the population. Interviews were conducted by telephone.
It is estimated that less than 1% of the populations does not own a phone
or mobile phone according to the Post and Telecom Adnministaration 96% 
have access to a landline. 

Approximately 25.2% of the total eligible population were excluded from 
the sample. These were 7.5% (24,024 / 307,672) persons who had requested
that their name would not be included in any sample drawn from the 
National registry according to information from Statistics Iceland. 
Another around 17.7/ (N=2,600; sample) were excluded because their phone 
numbers were not listed. Only some unlisted numbers were looked up using 
home address and surnames of respondents.

(3) The data set includes a weight variable (C1010_2) for age, as e.g. 
proportionally fewer in the younger age groups replied to the survey 
compared to the distribution of age in the population according to
information from Statistics Iceland. 

The weight variable was calculated by dividing the proportion of each
age according in the population with the proportion of age in the sample.
The total number of person in the population on the age from 18 to 80 were
229,659, January 1, 2009. Of them 4,943 were 18 years old 
(year of birth=2001), or 2.2% of the total. In the sample, 0.5% were 
18 (year of birth=1999, N=1,385). The weight for 18 years old is therefore
2.2/0.5=4.26


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - IRELAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 29 April 2007, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern asked the country's 
President, Mary McAleese, to dissolve the parliament, paving the way for 
elections to the House of Representatives on 24 May. 

Since 1997, Mr. Ahern, of the Fianna Fáil party, has led a coalition 
government with the Progressive Democrats. In the last elections held in 
May 2002, the two parties won 81 and eight seats respectively, controlling
89 of the 166 seats. The main opposition Fine Gael and the Labour Party 
took 31 and 21 seats each. 

A total of 466 candidates ran for the 2007 elections, in which Mr. Ahern 
sought a third term in office. 

The country enjoyed strong economic growth under the coalition government. 
Mr. Ahern, who had played a major role in political reconciliation in 
Northern Ireland, helped broker another power-sharing agreement in early 
May 2007. He pledged tax cuts, free health screening, and higher pensions.
However, he suffered a setback when news leaked that he had received money
from a friend to renovate a house in Dublin, which he subsequently bought.

Fianna Fáil's partner, the Progressive Democrats, was led by Justice 
Minister Michael McDowell. During the election campaign, Mr. McDowell was
faced a scandal involving the country's most secure prison, from which a 
convicted armed robber had phoned a call-in TV show using a mobile phone.
Further investigation revealed the presence of illegal drugs and smuggled 
mobile phones within the prison, which raised public concern. 

Fine Gael, led by Mr. Enda Kenny, and the Labour Party of Mr. Pat Rabbitte,
formed a centre-left alliance. Both parties criticized the government for 
failing to improve public services. Fine Gael presented a platform 
entitled, promising improved health services, more resources for tackling 
crime, better childcare services, and fairer taxes. 

The coalition government remained the largest group in the House of 
Representatives by winning a total of 80 seats (78 went to Fianna Fáil 
and two to the Progressive Democrats), but failed to win an absolute 
majority. The opposition Fine Gael gained 20 more seats, winning 51, 
with the Labour Party taking 20 seats. The Greens took six seats, while
Sinn Fein took four. The five remaining seats went to independent 
candidates. 

In all, 22 women were elected. The new House of Representatives will have
41 first-time MPs. 

On 14 June, the newly-elected House of Representatives held its first 
session and elected Mr. John O'Donoghue (Fianna Fáil) as its new Speaker. 

After three weeks of negotiations, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats
and the Greens agreed to form a coalition government. 

On 15 June, the House of Representatives re-elected Mr. Ahern as Prime 
Minister, with the support of his coalition partners and three of the 
five independent members.

(2) For the 2007 survey, 2135 respondents who had responded in 2002 were 
selected (excluding only those who had died or who had moved in the 
intervening years and no follow-up address was available). Interviews were
obtained from 1013 people. A short mail questionnaire was sent to 
nonrespondents and this succeeded in getting 130 replies. 43 percent of 
interviews were completed by the end of June, a month after the election,
with 88 percent completed by the end of July and 95 percent by the end of
August.

In addition, a supplementary three-stage sample was selected from the 
GeoDirectory (a national listing of all addresses). At the first stage, 
addresses were clustered by electoral division, with ED’s aggregated to 
give a minimum population of 1,000 addresses. One cluster was selected at
random within each of 39 Constituencies. At the second stage, addresses 
were selected at random from each cluster (total of 630 addresses). At the 
third stage, a respondent was selected within the household so as to 
over-represent adults who would not be included in the follow-up sample. 

The rule was as follows:

If the household contains one or more person age 18-23 who is registered 
to vote, use the next birthday rule to select the respondent from this 
group. If the household contains no adult age 18 to 23, select the 
respondent with the next birthday from this group (must be eligible to 
vote in national election).

If the household contains one or more person age 18-23 who is registered 
to vote, use the next birthday rule to select the respondent from this 
group. If the household contains no adult age 18 to 23, select the 
respondent with the next birthday from this group (must be eligible to 
vote in national election). From there 283 interviews were obtained. 
Nine responses to the mail questionnaire were received from other than 
the target respondents and these are also included.

The PSUs were Electoral Divisions (ED)or aggregates of electoral divisions.
EDs were aggregated so that each PSU had a minimum size of 1,000 electors
(2002) or 1,000 addresses (2007). PSUs were selected using a systematic 
sample, having sorted by area and characteristics of area (socio-economic 
status, urban-rural location), with a random start. The sort means that an 
element of stratification is incorporated. 

(3) There are two sets of weight variables for 2007, one looking back to the 
2002 sample and a second providing a representative cross section in 2007.
For the follow-up (panel) sample, the weight from 2002 was carried forward
to the 2007 sample. The resulting sample was then calibrated to population
totals from 2002 using a minimum distance algorithm (Gross, developed by 
Johanna Gomulka).

For the 2007 cross-sectional sample, a design weight was first applied
(based on number of adults age 18 and over in the household) to the 
supplementary sample, the 2002 weight was carried forward for the panel
sample, and the weighted (by design weight/2002 weight) sample totals were
calibrated to the population totals using the Gross minimum distance 
algorithm. These population totals are from the 2006 Census and the 
Quarterly National Household Survey in terms of household size (number of
adults age 18 and over), age, sex, education, economic status, marital 
status and region.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - ISRAEL (2006)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for November 2006, were 
held on 28 March 2006, four months after the collapse of Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon's government on 20 November 2005. The government had been in  
difficulty since Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip began in August 
2005, which caused rifts within Mr. Sharon's Likud Party. On 9 November
2005, Amir Peretz became leader of the Labour Party, and took Labour out of 
the coalition government. Mr. Sharon, who had helped found the centre-right 
Likud Party in 1973, subsequently established a new party called Kadima 
("Forward" in Hebrew). Mr. Sharon said Kadima would seek to end the 
long-time domination of Israeli politics by Likud and Labour. He announced 
that his party would support the creation of a Palestinian State, while at
the same time maintaining all of Jerusalem under Israeli control. A number 
of leading figures on the left and right, including former Labour leader 
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mr. Shimon Peres, and Likud Defence Minister
Shaul Mofaz, joined the new party. 

Mr. Sharon suffered a major stroke in mid-December 2005, which left him 
incapacitated and unable to continue his political duties. Nevertheless, 
his legacy continued to cast a shadow over the election campaign. Kadima 
was led into the elections by interim Prime Minister Mr. Ehud Olmert. Mr. 
Peretz emphasized Labour's social platform, while Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, 
who had been elected as Likud's new leader in December 2005, insisted that 
additional unilateral territorial pullbacks would merely increase Israel's
vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Many observers viewed the elections as
a referendum on future policy in the occupied territories of the West Bank. 

Voting went off without any major incidents although a record low 63.55 
percent of the five million registered voters turned out at the polls. 

The final results gave Kadima 29 seats, followed by the Labour Party with 
19 seats. Other possible coalition partners for Kadima won a total of 30 
seats: the Sephardi ultra-orthodox Shas party obtained 12, followed by the 
Gil (Pensioners Party) with a surprising seven seats; the ultra-orthodox 
Torah Judaism and the left-wing Meretz respectively won six and five seats. 
On the right, Likud came in first with 12 seats, followed by the far-right 
parties Yisrael Beitenu and the National Union - National Religious Party 
(Ichud Leumi- Mafdal: NRP) which won respectively 11 and nine seats. The 
remaining ten seats went to three predominantly Arab parties: Hadash, 
National Democratic Alliance (Balad) and United Arab List (Ra'am). After 
one month of negotiations, on 30 April 2006, Kadima formed a coalition 
government with Labour, Shas and Gil, thus controlling 67 seats in the 
120-member Parliament."

(2) The CSES module was implemented between June 17 and July 28, 2006,
after the March 18 election through telephonic interviews. The sample 
consists of 1200 persons aged 18 years or older who are citizens of Israel. 
The primary sampling unit is the household, randomly selected. Telephone
listings were employed to determine the random selection of households (not
through random digit dial (RDD), but listed). Final selection was made 
according to which person answered the phone and corresponded to the above
criteria. The final sample consists of a stratified sample of Jews, Arabs
and former Soviet Union immigrants by geographical areas, and random
sampling in each of the strata. The sample excludes some parts of the 
population, for instance Arabs who live in east Jerusalem; because they 
are not citizens of Israel, (East Jerusalem Arabs are about 3% of the 
Israeli population). Military persons while at home were included, but not
those who were in military camps at the time of the study. 
Institutionalized individuals were also excluded from the sample 
since there is no telephone in such institutions. All other households 
without access to a telephone, or are not listed in the telephone directory, 
were excluded by default: households without telephones represent about 13% 
of total households. A quota sampling method was used for the group of 
immigrants from the former USSR. However, no substitution of individuals 
permitted at any stage of the selection process or during fieldwork. 
Response rate was 10.02%, from 11977 valid households (13780 total), 1200 
interviews were completed (6950 refused or broke-off, while 3827 were not 
successfully contacted).

(3) There is no weight variable for this election study given that weights
are not necessary to make the population under study representative of 
the general population of Israel.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - JAPAN (2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "General elections were held on 29 July for half of the 242-member 
House of Councillors, the Upper Chamber of the Japanese Diet. Incumbent 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised to build a "beautiful country" and 
pledged to resolve the issue of individuals believed to have been abducted 
by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. A once
popular negotiator for the victims of abductions, the new Prime Minister 
soon faced a series of scandals. These included missing records of some 50
million pensioners, suicide by a government minister over alleged misuse of 
political funds, and controversy over the statement by the then Defense 
Minister on the use of the atomic bomb by the US during World War II. 
A total of 377 candidates (218 for the prefectural constituencies, and 159 
under the party list) contested the 2007 elections. Former Peruvian 
President, Alberto Fujimori, who was under house arrest in Chile, filed his 
candidature under the proportional representation list of the People's New 
Party, a small opposition party formed by dissidents of the LDP prior to 
the 2005 elections to the House of Representatives (lower chamber).
Before the elections, the parties in the coalition government - the LDP and 
the New Komeito - controlled 133 of the 242 seats in the House of 
Councillors (with one independent member supporting the LDP), of which 76 
were up for renewal in 2007. 

Changes in the electoral law reduced the number of seats in the LDP 
stronghold in rural areas and attributed more seats to big cities like 
Tokyo. Both parties targeted the 29 constituencies where only one seat was 
being renewed. The DPJ leader, Mr. Ichiro Ozawa said that he would resign 
if the ruling coalition retained its majority. 

During the election campaign, a major earthquake hit the northern part of 
Japan on 16 July. All parties pledged to take sufficient measures to rescue 
people and restore public safety. 

In all, over 58 per cent of the 104 million registered voters turned out at 
the polls. 

The ruling LDP suffered a heavy defeat, taking only 37 seats, The total 
number of LDP seats was reduced to 83 in the 242-member House of 
Councillors, which meant that the LDP lost control of the chamber for the 
first time since the party's inception in 1955. The LDP's coalition partner, 
the New Komeito, took nine seats. Inversely, the opposition DPJ won a record 
60 seats and became the largest party in the House of Councillors. Other 
seats went to small parties and independent candidates. The former Peruvian 
President, Mr. Fujimori, was not elected. 

In all, 26 women were elected, a record high in the history of the House of 
Councillors. The total number of women thus rose to 42, or 17.36 per cent. 
Following the defeat of the ruling coalition, Mr. Hidenao Nakagawa resigned 
as LDP Secretary General. Prime Minister Abe announced that he would stay in 
office and renew his cabinet in September. 

On 7 August, the newly-elected members were sworn in. Mr. Satsuki Eda (DPJ) 
was elected as the new President, becoming the first opposition member to 
hold the post. Ms. Akiko Santo (LDP) became the first female Vice-President 
of the House of Councillors. 

On 27 August, Prime Minister Abe announced a new 18-member cabinet 
comprising the LDP and the New Komei Party. However, another financial 
scandal forced the new Agriculture Minister, Mr. Takehiko Endo, to resign 
only a week after the cabinet reshuffle. 

On 9 September, Prime Minister Abe said he would make every effort to extend 
the Japanese refuelling mission in support of the US-led operation in 
Afghanistan and would not remain in his post unless it is agreed to. On 12 
September, he announced he would resign, saying the country needed a new 
leader to fight terrorism 

On 23 September, the LDP chose 71 year old veteran politician Mr. Yasuo 
Fukuda as its new President. Prime Minister Abe formally resigned on 25 
September. On the same day, Mr. Fukuda was elected as its new Prime 
Minister. Mr. Fukuda became the first prime minister of Japan whose father 
had also held the same post. He subsequently formed a new government, 
including most members of Mr. Abe's reshuffled cabinet."

(2) The post election study for CSES module 3 of Japan was carried out
between July 31, 2007 and August 13, 2007 as face-to-face-interviews. The 
original sample was part of a panel study, the Asian Barometer, referring 
to all Japanese voters aged 20 years or older, who are Japanese citizens
and registered as voters. The sample was filled up with additional 
addresses to enlarge the total sample size. This additional sample part was
processed in a two-step manner: The primary sampling units had been the
electoral districts, sampled with probability-proportional-to-size (PPS)
selection. From each district, about 8-14 samples (based on the population
in each district) were selected with an equal probability sampling
mechanism (EPSEM). In the second step, individual respondents were
randomly selected, based on the voting registry. The selected persons
were informed by letter before the first interviewer contact.
The interviewers themselves were mostly been females (84%) aged 50
years or older (70% irrespectively of the gender). 45% of the
interviewers had experience of more than ten years and were continuously
trained. Finally, an incentive of 1000 Yen (about US$9) was paid
to respondents for any successfully completed interview. 

(3) As the implementation of the CSES Module 3 notes, Japan used two 
different samples for CSES module 3. Consequently weights are necessary to 
make the sample representative of the population being studied and to 
compensate bias and potential skewness in relevant demographic factors. The 
included weights in the original data file were constructed by strata of 
six layers of age (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and over 70) and gender, based 
on the frequencies of Population Census of Japan 2005.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - MEXICO (2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "Mexicans went to the polls on 2 July 2006 to elect all members of the 
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate as well as a new President. The main 
issues in the 2006 elections were the high crime rate, poverty and 
undocumented Mexican workers in the United States. The PAN endorsed Mr. 
Felipe Calderon as its presidential candidate and presented tough policies
on crime, including life sentences for kidnappers. The PRD, led by the 
former Mayor of Mexico City, Mr. Manuel Lopez Obrador, formed an alliance,
called the "Alliance for the Good of All", with the Labor Party and the 
Convergence Party (CONV). The alliance fought the elections under the 
slogan "For the Good of All, the poor first", pledging to improve 
healthcare and education. The Alliance for Mexico coalition was composed of
the PRI and the Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The PRI, led by former 
senator Mr. Roberto Madrazo, pledged to create nine million jobs inside 
Mexico to prevent Mexican workers migrating to the United States. Other 
main parties in the 2006 elections were the New Alliance Party (NA), formed
by former PRI member Mr. Roberto Campa, and the Social Democratic and 
Peasant Alternative Party (ALT), led by the prominent civil and women 
rights activist, Ms. Patricia Mercado. 

The final results for parliamentary elections gave a resounding victory to 
the ruling PAN in both chambers, winning 206 seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies, up from 158 [1]; and 52 seats in the Senate [2]. The Alliance for
the Good of All won respectively 158 and 36 seats. The Alliance for Mexico
took 123 and 39 seats. In the presidential election, a narrow margin 
separated the leading candidates. After a partial recount, Mr. Calderon was
declared elected on 6 July with 35.88 per cent of the valid votes [3], just
0.6 percentage points ahead of Mr. Lopez Obrador. On 8 July, 100,000 people
responded to Mr. Obrador's call to protest the election results. He filed a
legal challenge to the results on 10 July, alleging widespread fraud and 
calling for a manual recount of every ballot. On 6 September, the Federal 
Electoral Tribunal confirmed the victory of Mr. Calderon. He was sworn in 
as President of Mexico on 1 December 2006."

(2) This is a face-to-face, post-election study focused on the Mexican
presidential and legislative elections of 2006. The sample was selected 
through a multistage procedure in which the universe was stratified in 
four regions according to geography and partisanship of the state governor.
An independent sample was drawn within each region. Within each region, the
primary sampling units were electoral precincts clusters. The clusters were
defined as groups of all of the precincts with similar vote for PRI and 
belonging to the same county (municipality). In the second stage the 
precincts within the clusters were selected with probability proportional 
to size (PPS). The third stage had been blocks randomly selected in the
precinct area In each block, houses are selected following systematic 
methods of random start households within the  precinct and the 
last stage was the respondent in the selected household. Respondents in the
household were not selected randomly. Interviewers followed quotas of 
gender and age. The response rate was calculated to be 46.5%.

(3) Weights are estimated and used to correct for unequal probability on 
the selection of sampling units. Additionally, post stratification weights 
were estimated to correct for non-response and to match known demographic 
characteristics of the population gender and age.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - MEXICO (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "At stake in the July 2009 elections were 500 seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies. In the previous elections held in July 2006 in parallel with 
the elections to the Senate and the presidency, the National Action Party 
(PAN) won 206 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) and Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took
126 and 104 [1] seats respectively. Five other parties won less than 20 
seats each. Mr. Felipe Calderon (PAN) won the presidential elections, 
pledging to tackle crime. 

Upon assuming the post in December 2006, President Calderon launched a war
on drug gangs by deploying thousands of troops. However, drug-related
violence remained rampant, killing over 6,000 people in 2008 and the first
half of 2009. The global economic crisis that originated in the United 
States severely affected Mexico. Although President Calderon responded by 
implementing tax cuts for business and investing in infrastructure 
projects, Mexico's economy was expected to shrink by 5.5 per cent in 2009.
In April 2009, the country was hit by an outbreak of swine flu (H1N1 
influenza). By the end of June, it had killed over 100 people and 
affected some 10,000 people. Although the election campaign officially
started on 3 May, most parties initially refrained from holding rallies due
to the epidemic. In the run-up to the polls, rallies were held in 
accordance with government health guidelines, requiring participants to 
stay at least seven feet away from each other. 

In the 2009 elections, the PAN was once again challenged by the PRI. The 
latter had dominated the country's presidency from 1929 until the election
of Mr. Vicente Fox (PAN) in 2000. PRI's new leader, Ms. Beatriz Elena 
Paredes Rangel, emphasized that the party had learned from its errors, 
referring to past corruption problems. The PRI used a slogan "proven 
experience, new attitude", recalling over seven decades of the party's 
leadership. It pledged to provide new economic policies to tackle the 
economic crisis. 

President Calderon pledged to continue to tackle crime. According to the 
government, crime-related deaths dropped by 26 per cent in the first 
trimester of 2009. He urged voters' to allow the PAN to continue to work
for economic growth, job creation and public safety. 
The PRD led by Mr. Jesús Ortega also vowed to tackle organized crime. 
However, it was reportedly losing ground due to internal splits. 
Polling took place without major incidents in most areas, except in the
state of Guerrero where 11 people, including a PRD town councilor and 
his family, were killed. 

Turnout was reportedly low among the 78 million registered voters. 

The PRI won a decisive victory securing 237 seats, up from 104 [1]. The PAN
came in second with 143 seats, losing 63. The PRD took 71 seats, losing
55 [2]. Of all the eight parties represented in the outgoing Chamber, only 
the Social Democratic and Peasant Alternative Party (ALT) failed to win 
seats. 141 women were elected [3].  
On 29 August, the newly elected Chamber of Deputies held its first session
and elected Mr. Francisco Ramírez Acuña (PAN) as its new Speaker."

(2) This is a face-to-face, post-election study focused on the Mexican
legislative elections of 2009 and is representative of the national 
population 18 years or older. The sample was selected by a multistage 
procedure in which the universe was stratified in three dominions: states
with elections for governor, states with local legislatures and states 
without concurrent elections. An independent sample was drawn within each 
region. In each dominion four layers of similar electoral competition were 
formed. In the first stage electoral sections were selected with 
probability proportional to size of the nominal listing (PPS). In the 
second stage blocks of houses were selected following systematic methods of
random start, and in a third stage houses within the blocks were chosen 
also following systematic methods of random start. In the households, 
respondents are selected according to more recent birthday. Response rate
was 58.9%.

(3) The Mexican data includes two different weights. A first sampling 
weight corrects for unequal probability of selection sampling units. A
second post-stratification weight is available to correct for non-response
and to match known demographic characteristics of the populations (gender

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2006) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

(1) Early elections were held for all seats in the House of Representatives 
on 22 November 2006. Elections to the House of Representatives had 
previously taken place on 22 January 2003. 

After the 2003 elections Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende formed a 
centre-right coalition government comprising the Christian Democrats (CDA 
44 seats) the free-market People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD 28 
seats) and the centrist Democrats-66 (D66 six seats). The Labour Party 
(PvdA) became the second largest party with 42 seats while the Socialist 
Party (SP) took nine seats. In September 2004 a group led by Mr. Geert 
Wilders broke from the VVD to found the Party for Freedom in disagreement 
with the VVD's position over Turkey's accession to the European Union. 

The coalition collapsed in late June 2006 when the D66 withdrew from the 
government following a row in parliament over the citizenship of Somali- 
born parliamentarian Ms. Ayaan Hirsi Ali (VVD). Prime Minister Balkenende 
led a caretaker government until the elections in which 24 parties and 683 
candidates including 207 women participated. 

The main electoral issues included economic reforms and immigration 
policies. Mr. Balkenende called on voters to support the strong economic 
recovery under his government and criticized the PvdA's plans to tax 
pensioners. The PvdA argued that the government was asking too much from 
citizens with low and medium income and not enough from the country's 
richest citizens. The SP leader Mr. Jan Marijnissen said he would put an 
end to excessive economic liberalism. 

Mr. Balkenende also pledged to continue his tough immigration policies 
insisting that illegal immigrants should be deported. The Immigration 
Minister Ms. Rita Verdonk (VVD) said that if reelected the government would 
ban the wearing of full-length veils (burqas) in public. The PvdA leader 
Mr. Wouter Bos insisted on the importance of the country's tradition of 
multi-culturalism and tolerance. The left-wing opposition argued in favour 
of a general pardon for an estimated 26000 asylum seekers whose 
applications had been previously turned down. 

80.35 per cent of the 12 million registered voters turned out at the polls. 

Neither the right nor the left won a clear majority. The Prime Minister's 
centre-right CDA remained the largest party with 41 seats. The VVD won 22 
the Party for Freedom took nine and the D66 three. The main left-wing 
opposition the PvdA remained the second largest party with 33 seats. The 
SP won 25 seats 16 more than in 2003 thus becoming the fourth largest 
party. The Green Left won seven seats while the centre-left Christian Union 
took six. 

The newly-elected House of Representatives held its first session on 30 
November 2006. On 6 December 2006 Ms. Gerdi Verbeet of the PvdA was elected 
Speaker at the third round of voting. Following a political stalemate over 
the formation of a new government Mr. Balkenende continued to act as 
caretaker Prime Minister. 

On 7 February 2007 the CDA the PvdA and the Christian Union agreed to form 
a new coalition government once again led by Mr. Balkenende. On 22 February 
Queen Beatrix swore in Mr. Balkenende's fourth government thus ending three 
months of political stalemate.

(2) The Dutch 2006 CSES study was included in The Dutch Parliamentary 
Election Study 2006 (DPES). The DPES 2006 consists of several parts: the 
first wave of interviews, the second wave of interviews, a self-completion 
questionnaire, a non-response project and a stimulus project. The first 
wave of interviews was held during the six weeks before the elections on 
November 22, 2006. The second wave of interviews was held shortly after the 
elections. The self-completion questionnaire was left with the respondents 
of the second wave, to fill in for themselves. A number of non-respondents 
of the first and second wave were approached with a telephone or written 
questionnaire. 

The second wave of interviews, containing the CSES questionnaire, was 
conducted between November 23, 2006 and January 4, 2007. The goal was to 
interview most people at the beginning of this period. In this second wave 
2359 respondents of the first wave were re-interviewed. They were again 
visited at their homes and interviews were conducted with an electronic 
questionnaire (CAPI) with questions that were different from the first 
wave. Note that most of demographic variables have been added to the 
datafile by Statistics Netherlands on the basis of population records 
(i.e., they were not part of the administered questionnaire. 

The study is based on a two-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage 
the primary units are selected and for every selected unit the number of 
secondary units to be selected is set. In the DPES 2006 the primary units 
were municipalities. Persons are the secondary unit. 
Within every municipality an equal preset number of persons is selected. 
After that the municipalities are selected with unequal chances in 
proportion to the number of persons in the municipalities in question. The 
largest municipalities, including Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and 
Utrecht, are automatically included in the sample. Persons in these 
municipalities are selected with an equal chance as the rest of the sample. 
This way a self weighing sample comes about, with a preset sample size. In 
the DPES the number of persons to be selected in every municipality was 12. 

In order to achieve a high response rate, respondents were carefully 
contacted. First, the respondents received a letter of introduction. 
Enclosed with this letter was a small set of stamps. Every respondent was 
visited at least once during the first half of the observation period of 
three weeks (see above). A card was left behind if the first three house 
calls were unsuccessful and the respondent was not present. After that, the 
interviewer tried to contact the intended respondent by phone in order to 
make an appointment for an interview. Meanwhile the interviewer kept 
visiting the address. An address could only be labelled as a definite 'no 
contact’ after six idle visits. 

When the response was achieved in the first wave, an appointment was made 
for a second wave interview. These appointments were planned as shortly as 
possible after the election date, so the responses of the second wave were 
concentrated at the beginning of the fieldwork period. It was also 
preferred that the interviewer of the second wave was the same person as 
the one that conducted the first interview. 

Respondents of the second wave interviews were asked to fill in a self- 
completion questionnaire. Persons that had not send in their questionnaire 
after a week received a letter of reminder with a new questionnaire and a 
reply envelope. 

Response rate in the pre-election wave was 66.9%. In the post-election 
wave, 89.9% of 1st wave participants took par, which makes 60.2% of the 
initial first-wave sample.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 12 September, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that the House of 
Representatives would be dissolved on 3 October and that elections would 
be held on 8 November. 

In the previous elections held in September 2005, Prime Minister Clark's 
Labour Party remained the biggest party by securing 50 seats in the 120 
member parliament, making her the first Labour leader to win three 
consecutive terms since World War II. The opposition National Party 
substantially increased its seats to 48 from 27 in the previous elections.
The following month, Ms. Clark announced a minority coalition with Jim 
Anderton's Progressive Party (one seat). She also secured the agreement 
of New Zealand First (seven seats) and the United Future (three seats) 
to extend confidence and support to her government. The Green Party (six 
seats) signed a cooperation agreement with the Labour led government 
promising not to oppose the government in confidence votes. The newly 
formed Maori Party (four seats) announced it would not support the new 
government. 

The 2008 elections once again saw a duel between the Labour Party and the 
National Party. Prior to the elections, scandals involving the Foreign 
Minister and the economic slowdown reportedly gave the opposition National
Party the lead in opinion polls. 

On 29 August, Foreign Minister and the leader of New Zealand First, Mr. 
Winston Peters, agreed to step aside while investigations were being 
conducted into alleged malpractice involving donations made to his party. 
Prime Minister Clark took over his portfolio. The National Party leader, 
Mr. John Key, accused the Prime Minister of taking too long to deal with 
the crisis. 

In late September, the national statistics office announced that the 
country's economy had fallen into recession for the first time since 1998.
The global financial crisis reportedly worsened the situation in the 
run-up to the elections. 

In the meantime, on 11 September, the Reserve Bank (central bank) 
announced an interest rate cut, allowing major banks to lower mortgage 
rates. On 1 October, the personal tax cuts for all workers announced in 
May 2008 took effect. The government said that the measures would help 
pull the economy out of recession. 

Prime Minister Clark argued that only the Labour Party could make tough 
choices for the country. She promised to use at least 3.4 per cent of 
biofuels in all transport fuels by 2012. She further promised a deposit 
guarantee scheme to protect investments, expanded training opportunities 
for youth, and a universal student allowance by abolishing parental income
testing. 

National Party leader John Key argued that the country needed change. 
He pledged to protect businesses from financial losses. His party's 
policies included income tax cuts and more spending on key infrastructure 
projects such as roads, schools and a broadband network. It promised to 
promptly execute dam projects on the West Coast, opposed by the Labour
government. He also promised to reduce the adverse effects on the economy
of the September 2008 Climate Change (Emissions Trading and Renewable 
Preference) Bill that established the framework for the Emissions Trading
Scheme for New Zealand. Emissions trading is a one of the primary tools of
international cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the 
Kyoto Protocol. 

Both the Labour and National parties pledged to maintain New Zealand's 
troops in Afghanistan but not to deploy them in Iraq. Moreover, they both 
endorsed the ban on nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed 
ships in New Zealand. 

The Green Party, led jointly by Ms. Jeanette Fitzsimons and Mr. Russel 
Norman, promised to reduce the country's dependence on oil and its CO2 
emissions. It argued that a strong Green presence in Parliament would 
bring about change in government. 

Mr. Peter Dunne's United Future Party and the Maori Party, led jointly
by Mr. Pita Sharples and Ms. Tariana Turia, aligned themselves with the
National Party. The ACT New Zealand, led by Mr. Rodney Hide, indicated 
that it would support the National Party. 

In all, 79.46 per cent of the 2.9 million registered voters turned out at
the polls. 

The final results gave 58 seats to the National Party and 43 to the 
Labour Party. The Greens won nine seats, followed by the ACT and the 
Maori Party, which took five seats each. The Progressive Party and the 
United Future won one seat each. New Zealand First failed to win any 
parliamentary representation. In all, 41 women were elected to a new 122 
member parliament (including two overhang seats, see note), up from 39 
women out of 121 members elected in 2005. 

On 19 November, Mr. Key was sworn in as Prime Minister by the Governor 
General Anand Satyanand together with 27 ministers. The newly elected 
Parliament held its first session on 8 December and elected Mr. Alexander
Lockwood Smith of the National Party as its new Speaker. 

Note: 
Under the New Zealand electoral system, seats are first allocated to 
candidates winning electoral seats. Parties will then get a share of 
seats in Parliament in keeping with their share of "party votes". 
In cases where parties win more electoral seats than their share of 
seats determined by the party vote, they may keep the extra seats, 
the so called "overhang seats". In the 2008 elections, the Maori Party
won two overhang seats.

(2) The study is meant to be representative of New Zealanders on the 
electoral roll immediately prior to the 2008 election. A very small number 
who  registered in the two weeks before the election were 
excluded. The sample is a random sample from the electronic electoral 
rolls. (A panel component was also present, but all data submitted to the 
CSES is from those freshly sampled for the 2008 election.)
Sampling units were selected using SPSS select casese (random sample).
Furthermore, the sample was partitioned into four groups. 
New Zealanders of Maori descent can choose to be registered on a 
separate Maori roll, and cast their electorate votes within seven 
constituencies that overlie the general electorates.  For its new sample
the 2008 New Zealand Election Study randomly sampled within four subsets
of registered voters and oversampled subsets 1, 3, and 4 below, groups of
particular interest to the researchers. 

1. Those on Maori roll 27 and over
2. Those on General roll 27 and over
3. Those on Maori roll 18-26
4. Those on General Roll 18-26

For the CSES release, respondents from the three oversampled subsets were
re-sampled to bring their numbers into the appropriate proportions among
registered voters, removing any need for sampling weights.
Those sampled were given the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire 
online but could only do so with the appropriate password and identifier.

Without reducing the full sample totals by any means (deceased, 
inaccessible, or anything else) percentages of respondents out of the 
totals originally sampled were:

General roll, 27 and over: 42.8%
General roll, 18-26: 22.0%
Maori roll, 27 and over: 27.3%
Maori roll, 18-26: 12.7%

Effective response rates would be somewhat higher if deceased and 
inaccessibles were removed from the denominator, but the New Zealand 
electoral roll is well maintained and therefore quite up to date.

Population data for age and sex comes from the electronic version of the 
rolls used for sampling. Age groups are reported in five-year bands.  
The target sex ratio was estimated from a separate sample of 10,000 from 
the roll data. This data is only available under conditions of 
confidentiality for purposes of social science research from the Electoral
Enrolment Centre. Education data comes from the 2006 census, available 
online at the Statistics New Zealand website.

The large discrepancies reflect to some extent the propensity of 
respondents to be concentrated among the more educated. However, 
highest qualification data available from the New Zealand latest census
in 2006 does not tie in particularly well to the codes requested by the 
CSES or those most respondents would recognize in a survey. The New 
Zealand qualifications framework has changed significantly over the last 
thirty years, making older respondents responses’ difficult to reconcile
with current codes. I simply don’t believe that 45% of people over 15 in 
New Zealand in 2008 had no education or had not completed primary school
- what this data apparently signifies, (New Zealand’s minimum school 
leaving age was set at 15 in 1944, with most children leaving primary 
school at age 12). Accumulating from lower qualifications upward, the 
percentage without post-secondary qualifications in the 2006 census data
is 63 per cent: in the weighted sample it is 55 per cent. However, the 
most obvious discrepancy is the proportion of university-educated, twice 
what it should be.  An alternative weight is available to adjust for this,
along with sex and age, although not included in this version of the CSES 
deposit.

(3) The weights were designed to match known sex and age distributions in 
the electoral roll from which the sample was taken.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - NORWAY (2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "Norwegians went to the polls on 12 September 2005 to elect an enlarged 
parliament of 169 members, up from 165. Since the 2001 elections, when the
Labour Party had suffered its worst result in 90 years, the country had
been led by a center-right minority coalition under Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik, which controlled 62 of 165 seats in parliament
(Stortinget). The coalition was composed of three parties: the Prime
Minister's Christian People's Party, the Conservatives and the Liberal
Party. The coalition also had support from the far right Progress Party,
known for its anti-immigration policy, which had won 26 seats in the 2001
elections, bringing the number of seats controlled by government to 88. The
three main opposition parties formed the Red-Green alliance composed of
former Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's Labour Party, the Socialist Left
Party and the Centre Party (Agrarians), holding 76 seats in all. One MP
represented the Coastal Party, defending the interests of fishing
communities and opposing membership of the European Union. 77.4 per cent of
Norway's 3.4 million eligible voters cast their ballots on election day.

Final results gave an absolute majority of 87 seats to the Red-Green 
alliance, while the outgoing government and its ally, the Progress Party, 
won a total of 82 seats. Within the winning coalition, the Labour Party 
increased its seats to 61, up from 43 in the 2001 elections. The Centre 
Party (Agrarians) obtained 11 seats, one more than the previous election, 
while the Socialist Left Party was reduced to 15 seats, having lost eight. 
The Conservative Party, the biggest party in the outgoing government, 
suffered its worst results in its history, retaining 23 seats and losing 
15. The Christian People's Party won 11 seats, down from 22. On the other 
hand, the Liberal Party won its largest number of seats ever: ten, up from 
two. The far-right Progress Party, led by Mr. Carl Hagen, increased its 
seats from 26 to 38, becoming the second largest party in the new 
parliament. The Coastal Party lost its only seat."

(2) The CSES module was implemented in a face-to-face post-election survey 
between September 13, 2005 and December 20, 2005. The original sample 
consists of 3000 persons aged 18-79 years which is part of an rolling panel 
(half of the sample replaced at each election). The sample is selected from 
registers covering all Norwegian inhabitants, and in accordance with 
Statistics Norway's sampling frame. Local municipalities are employed as 
primary sampling units (psus). In Norway there are 435 municipalities in 19 
counties, but municipalities with very few inhabitants were pooled with 
adjacent municipalities to form one psu. A total of 363 psus were then 
stratified into 109 strata. Stratification variables were industrial 
structure, number of inhabitants, centrality, communication structures, 
commuting patterns, trade areas and (local) media coverage. Stratification 
was done such that no psu had less than 7 per cent of the total population 
in its stratum, and separately for each county. All psus with more than 
30000 inhabitants, and some with a population number between 25000 and 
30000, constitute separate strata. For the remaining psus, the most
possible homogeneous strata was formed. In a second stage one psu was
selected from each stratum. Psus which constituted separate strata were
included with certainty. For the remaining strata, one unit was drawn with
probability proportional to the number of inhabitants. A sample of survey
units (persons) was drawn from the population register, selected from the
109 sampling areas, using systematic random sampling. The sampling fraction
at the second stage is proportional with the inverse selection probability
at the first stage. The final sample then is self-weighting when both
stages are taken into consideration. If a sampled unit from the panel
sample has moved out of their original psu, it is still included in the
sample. Response rate was 68%. The total amount of households in the
sample was 2965, out of which 2012 interviews were completed (655 refused
or broke-off, 142 were not successfully contacted, 156 other non-response).

(3) No weights are necessary to make the sample representative of the 
population, hence weights are not included in the data file.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - POLAND (2005)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) On 25 September 2005, parliamentary elections were held for both 
chambers  of the Polish Parliament: the 460-seat lower house (Sejm) and the
100-seat Senate (Senat), in parallel with presidential elections. Since the
fall of communism in 1989, no government had ever been re-elected in this 
country of 38.5 million inhabitants.

The left-wing coalition government formed after the 2001 elections was 
originally composed of Prime Minister Marek Belka's Democratic Left 
Alliance (SLD), which was the successor of the communist Polish United 
Workers Party, and the Labour Union (UP).This coalition held 216 seats in
the Sejm and 75 seats in the Senate. The Polish Peasant Party (PSL), 
holding 42 seats in the lower house and 4 seats in the upper house, also 
joined the coalition later on.

The outgoing government had come to power promising to deal with 
unemployment, which had reached 16 per cent. In May 2004, Mr. Belka was 
sworn in as prime minister after the then prime minister, Mr. Leszek 
Miller, resigned due to corruption scandals soon after Poland's accession 
to the European Union (EU). Mr. Belka's policies included tax cuts and an 
increase in social spending, but these reforms were reportedly hampered by 
disagreements within his party. Despite the increase in foreign investments
following the country's accession to the EU, unemployment remained high due
to the Polish baby boom of the early 1980s. It stood at about 18 per cent 
in July 2005, the highest among the EU Member States. Long-running 
corruption scandals involving the SLD took the centre stage during the 
election campaign. Following the scandals, some SLD members left the party 
in 2004 and formed the Polish Social Democracy-Labour Union Greens 
Coalition (SdPl); it joined forces with the UP for the 2005 elections.

The main rivals of the outgoing government were two centre-right parties, 
the Civic Platform (PO), led by Mr. Donald Tusk, a known free market 
advocate, and the more conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by Mr.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski. The two parties had won 65 and 44 seats respectively in
the Sejm in the 2001 elections. Mr. Tusk and Mr. Kaczynski's twin brother, 
Mr. Lech Kaczynski, were also candidates in the presidential election of 
October 2005. The two parties announced that they would seek to form a 
coalition government, although they proposed different tax policies during
the election campaign. The PO called for tax reform, including a flat 15 
per cent rate for income tax, corporate tax and VAT. The party also 
advocated more deregulation and privatization in order to adopt the 
European single currency, the euro, as soon as possible. The PiS proposed
milder changes, including the introduction of tax breaks and State 
assistance for the poor.

On election day about 40 per cent of the country's 30 million eligible 
voters turned out. Turnout has been declining steadily since 1989, when it
was recorded at 62 per cent.

The final results showed major progress for the PiS and the PO, which won 
155 and 133 seats respectively in the Sejm, and 49 and 34 seats in the 
Senate. Self-Defense, a populist grouping advocating State-funded 
agriculture and an increase in government social programmes, came in third
in the Sejm with 56 seats. The SLD suffered a heavy defeat, retaining only
55 seats in the Sejm and none in the Senate. These elections marked the 
left's worst results since its establishment as reformed communists in 
1990.

After the first round, the PiS leader, Mr. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, announced 
that he would not accept the post of prime minister in order to avoid 
jeopardizing his twin brother's presidential campaign. On 19 October, 
President Aleksander Kwasniewski formally asked Mr. Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz
of the PiS to become prime minister.

On 20 October, Mr. Bogdan Borusewicz, an independent senator supported by 
the PiS, was elected president of the Senate during the inaugural session 
of parliament. The PiS and the PO, however, failed to agree on a common 
candidate for a new president of the Sejm before the first session.

The run-off presidential election held on 23 October recorded a 50.91% 
turnout. Mr. Lech Kaczynski beat Mr. Tusk by securing 54.04 per cent of the
votes.

On 26 October 2005, Mr. Marek Jurek of the PiS was elected president of the
Sejm , with the backing of the PiS, Self-Defense, the League of Polish 
Families (LPR), the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), and one independent member.

The PiS and the PO were unable to agree on the formation of a coalition 
government. Consequently, the new prime minister, Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz,
formed a one-party minority government on 31 October. On 10 November 2005,
Prime Minister designate Marcinkiewicz won a vote of confidence in the 
Sejm, with support from the same groups as the previous vote, as well as 
from five of six independent parliamentarians.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - POLAND (2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Following the collapse of the ruling coalition in August, parliamentary 
elections were held on 21 October 2007, two years earlier than the 
official due date. 

In the previous elections held in September 2005 in parallel with
presidential elections, the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, led 
by Mr. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, won 155 of the 460 seats in the Sejm (lower 
house), while the Civic Platform (PO) led by a well-known free market 
advocate, Mr. Donald Tusk, took 133. The latter's presidential election 
rival and the PiS leader's twin brother, Mr. Lech Kaczynski, was elected 
as the country's new President. 

The PiS and the PO, which won 49 and 34 seats respectively in the 100-
member Senate, were unable to agree on the formation of a coalition 
government. Consequently, prime minister-elect, Mr. Kazimierz 
Marcinkiewicz (PiS), formed a one-party minority government on 31 October 
2005. His government won a vote of confidence in the Sejm on 10 November, 
with the support of the PiS, the Self-Defence Party (which won 56 seats 
in the Sejm, and three in the Senate), the League of Polish Families 
(LPR, 34 and seven seats respectively), the Polish Peasant Party (PSL, 25 
and two seats), as well as some independent parliamentarians. 

However, Prime Minister Marcinkiewicz, known for his moderate economic 
and foreign policy, was reportedly in conflict with the country's 
President, Mr. Kaczynski. In July 2006, Mr. Marcinkiewicz resigned as 
Prime Minister, and was succeeded by the President's twin brother, 
Jaroslaw Kaczynski (PiS). The latter then formed a coalition with the 
Self-Defence Party, led by Mr. Andrzej Lepper and the LPR of Mr. Roman 
Giertych. The new government experienced tensions with the Russian 
Federation and the European Union, partly due to its resistance to the 
privatization of certain State-owned companies. 

Mr. Kaczynski's government underwent a series of crises before it 
officially collapsed in August 2007. The Self-Defence Party leader and 
Agriculture Minister Mr. Lepper, was dismissed in July following 
corruption allegations, while Interior Minister Janusz Kaczmarek of the 
PiS was dismissed in August. Both coalition partners withdrew their 
ministers from the government. Mr. Kaczmarek was arrested in late August, 
accused of leaking classified information on the investigation into 
corruption charges brought against Mr. Lepper. Opposition parties accused 
the Prime Minister of trying to silence his opponents prior to snap 
elections. 

On 7 September, the Sejm voted to dissolve itself, paving the way for 
early elections - the eighth since the fall of communism in 1989. 

In all, 6,187 candidates, including 1,428 women, ran for the Sejm, while 
385 candidates, including 46 women, vied for seats in the Senate. 

The 2007 elections again saw a duel between the PiS, led by Mr. Jaroslaw 
Kaczynski, and the PO of Mr. Tusk. The PiS promised to continue its 
policies, focusing on the domestic economy and promising tax cuts. It 
appealed to voters to support it in the interest of steady economic 
growth. The PO pledged to introduce a flat income tax of 15 per cent and 
to continue the privatization of State companies that stagnated under the 
PiS-led government. It promised to forge better ties with neighbouring 
countries, and pledged to introduce the European single currency - the 
Euro - as soon as possible, to further economic development. Mr. Tusk 
also promised to work towards the withdrawal of Polish troops from Iraq. 

The Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), which had won 55 seats in the Sejm in 
the 2005 elections, formed an election coalition - LiD - with the Social 

Democracy of Poland (SDPL), the Democratic Party (PD), and the Labour 
Union (UP) in September 2006. The coalition was led by former president 
Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski. He criticized the PiS-led government, arguing 
that the country could not afford a radical reduction of taxation. 

A total of 53.88 per cent of the country's 30 million registered voters 
turned out at the polls, representing the highest turnout in the post-
communist era. Due to the higher than expected turnout, some polling 
stations ran out of ballot papers, and others stayed open longer than 
scheduled, thus delaying the release of the first exit polls by nearly 
three hours. 

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observed 
the polls. Although it declared the elections to be pluralistic and 
democratic, it noted "sporadic partial interventions by State organs" in 
the election campaign. 

The final results gave the PO 209 seats in the Sejm and 60 seats in the 
Senate. The PiS took 166 and 39 seats respectively. The LiD and the 
Polish Peasant Party (PSL) took 53 and 31 seats in the Sejm, while the 
remaining one seat went to the German minority. One independent candidate 
was elected to the Senate. Outgoing Prime Minister, Mr. Jaroslaw 
Kaczynski, conceded defeat. 

The newly elected parliament held its first session on 5 November. The 
Sejm elected Mr. Bronislaw Komorowski (PO) as its new Speaker, while Mr. 
Bogdan Borusewicz (independent) was re-elected as the Senate President. 
On 9 November, President Kaczynski designated Mr. Tusk as Prime Minister. 
His new cabinet was officially sworn in on 16 November. It won a vote of 
confidence in the Sejm on 23 November.

(2) The Polish interviews were held face-to-face as a post election survey.
Sampling was based on a four stage process, drawn accordingly to the 60 
territorial layers, defined on the basis of country region and size of the 
accommodation areas. Thereby the number of observations from each layer in 
the sample was proportional to the number of people from a given layer in
the population. In a first stage, district districts were chosen randomly. 
Second, within each of the selected districts, a sample of streets or 
resorts was drawn. In the third step, based on the map of streets or 
resorts, addresses of houses and apartments had been selected. Finally, 
within each of the chosen houses or apartments one person was randomly 
sampled. 

(3) The data include a demographic weight to make the sample comparable to 
the overall Polish population. Researcher should be aware of the fact that 
the construction rules of the weight as well as the used data for benchmark
are unknown, so far.

>>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - PORTUGAL (2009)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The September 2009 elections were held against the backdrop of the 
global economic crisis, which severely affected the country of 10 million 
inhabitants. The country's economy contracted by 3.7 per cent in the second
quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The unemployment rate
increased from 7.9 to 9.1 per cent, the highest in 20 years. The State 
budget deficit is expected to exceed 6 per cent of gross domestic product 
(GDP) in 2009. 

In the previous elections held in February 2005 (see note), the Socialist 
Party (PS) won 121 of the 230 seats in the Assembly of the Republic. The 
then ruling Social Democratic Party (PPD/PSD) took 75. Mr. Jose Socrates 
(PS) became the new Prime Minister. 

Mr. Socrates implemented a series of economic and social reforms, promising
to make the Portuguese economy more competitive. These reforms helped 
reduce the budget deficit from 6.1 per cent in 2005 to 1.8 per cent in 
2007, prior to the arrival of the global economic crisis. 

How to deal with the economic crisis remained the main issue in the 2009 
elections, in which 15 political parties were vying for seats. 

Prime Minister Socrates promised to implement large-scale public works 
projects to create more jobs. These included a new Lisbon airport, a bullet
train to Spain as well as a road and rail bridge across the River Tagus in
Lisbon. He also promised to continue economic and social reforms. 

The largest opposition party, the PPD/PSD, was led by Ms. Manuela Ferreira 
Leite, who was aspiring to become Portugal's first elected woman prime 
minister. Ms. Ferreira Leite argued that the PS's public works projects 
were wasteful and a non-essential luxury. She claimed that the PS would be
passing on debts to future generations. Ms. Ferreira Leite, a former 
finance minister, pledged to make huge cuts in government spending and 
boost private investment to revive the economy. The PPD/PSD promised to 
improve the reform plans by pursuing broader consensus. Although the 
PPD/PSD had ruled the country with the PS in the 1980s, Ms. Ferreira Leite
vehemently rejected such a coalition during the election campaign. 

The Democratic and Social Centre - People's Party (CDS-PP) led by Mr. Paulo
Portas pledged to remain the best opposition force to the PS government. 
The Left Bloc (BE, which had won eight seats in 2005), led by Mr. Francisco
Louca, promised to introduce higher corporate taxes to pay for social 
services. Mr. Jeronimo de Sousa led the Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU)
comprising the Communist Party - Green Coalition (PCP-PEV). The CDU had won
14 seats in the 2005 elections. Both the BE and the CDU ruled out the 
possibility of joining a PS-led government. 

A total of 59.74 per cent of the 9.5 million registered voters turned out 
at the polls. 

The PS remained the largest party in the Assembly of the Republic with 97 
seats but failed to retain an absolute majority. The PPD/PSD took 81, six 
more than in the 2005 elections. The CDS-PP secured 21 seats, up from 12. 
The BE doubled its share from eight to 16. The PCP-PEV took the remaining 
15 seats. 64 women were elected. On 15 October, the Assembly of the 
Republic held its first session and re-elected Mr. Jaime Gama (PS) as its 
Speaker.

(2) The sample was stratified by five regions (according to the C2027), as 
well as by the population size of localities (according to C2030). All in 
all, 113 areas were randomly selected, based on the corresponding 
definition of the National Statistics Office. The sample excludes the 
islands of Azores and Madeira, as well as institutionalized and military 
persons.

The further sampling process contains of three stages: First, the selection
of a starting point within each of the localities, using lists of ZIP codes
and tables of random numbers. Next, households had been sampled according 
to the given starting points, based on pre-determined instructions about 
the route to adopt and a systematic interval of households. Finally, within
each of the selected households, respondents had been chosen on the basis 
of next person having his/her birthday. 

To be interviewed people must have been at least 18 years old at the day of
contact and had to be registered as voters. In contrast, the Portuguese 
citizenship was no requirement for participating in the post election 
study. Selected Households were informed by letters. Incentives or 
payments had not been given to the respondents, whether before, nor after
the interviews.

The interviewers received advanced training for the interviews, procedures
of contact, and the method of random route. Interviews took place between 
October 2nd, 2009 and February 8th, 2010.

In total, 7151 households were selected, out of which 3532 had been invalid
addresses due to several reasons. From the residual 3619 household, 1317 
had been successfully contacted and interviewed, which corresponds to a
recourse of 36.39%. After removing 13 ineligible interivews, 1303 cases 
remained.

(3) The data include a demographic weight to make the sample comparable to 
the overall Portuguese population aged 18 years or older. The weight is 
based on the distribution of the target population in terms of gender, age, 
and education, according to the Portuguese National Statistics Office 
Census 2001. Thirteen respondets from the source file, who had system 
missing values in the weight variable, were removed from the CSES dataset, 
due to their ineligibility status.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "The April 2008 elections were the first to be held under the country's
new President Lee Myung-bak of the Grand National Party (GNP), who was 
elected in December 2007. Prior to the 2008 elections, many new parties were
formed. In August 2007, the Uri Party disbanded itself. Most of its 
parliamentarians joined the newly-created United New Democratic Party
(UNDP), along with five former Democratic Party (DP) members. In October,
other former Uri Party members formed the Renewal of Korea Party. After the
2007 presidential elections, the UNDP merged with the DP and renamed itself
the "United Democratic Party" (UDP), led by Mr. Son Hak-gyu, while the 
Liberty Forward Party (LFP) merged with the People First Party (PFP).

In late March, Ms. Park Geun-hye - daughter of former president Park Chung-
hee and former GNP chairwoman - complained of the elimination of many of 
her supporters in the GNP's selection of parliamentary candidates. Many of 
her loyalists left the GNP to form a new party, Park's Party, while Ms. 
Park herself remained in the GNP. The economy and employment figured 
prominently in the campaign. The UDP promised to create more jobs through 
economic growth.

It pledged to work towards affording greater protection to the country's 
low- and middle-income families. The GNP leader, Kang Jae-sup, called on 
voters' to retrieve "the 10 years the country lost under incompetent 
liberal governments". Its manifesto included university reforms that would 
give more autonomy to universities. The GNP won 153 seats, securing a 
majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1998. The UDP 
took 81. The LFP came in third with 18 seats, followed by the Park's Party,
which took 14 seats. 

Around 30 elected GNP candidates were reportedly loyal to Ms. Park. The DLP 
took five seats while the NPP failed to win any. The Renewal of Korea Party 
won three seats. Only 46 per cent of the 37.8 million eligible voters 
turned out at the polls, down from 60 per cent recorded in the 2004 
elections."

(2) This study is a post-electoral, face-to-face study, conducted between 
April 10 and 21, 2008, immediately after the Parliamentary election of 
April 9, 2008. A multi-stage sampling procedure was employed: a) In a first
stage 80 electoral districts (PSU’s) were on randomly chosen; b) Voting 
districts within each electoral districts were randomly sampled, and c) 
Sample of voters, within each voting district, were drawn from the list of 
voters provided by the Central Election Management Committee. The sample 
frame excluded Cheju island and other small islands, since people in these 
regions, who comprise a very small percentage of the total population 
(less than 0.5%), are difficult and costly to contact. 

(3) The original data, provided by South Korea, did not include weights; 
due to the sampling procedure, weights are not necessary to make the sample
representative for the whole South Korean population.

last elections held in September 2002, the ruling Social Democratic Party 
(SAP), which had ruled the country for most of the period since 1932, won 
144 of the 349 seats. The SAP refused to enter into a coalition with the 
Left Party(VP) and the Greens (Mpg), mainly because of their opposition to
Sweden's membership of the European Union. SAP leader and Prime Minister, Mr.
Göran Persson, subsequently formed a minority government that relied on the 
support of the VP and the Mpg to pass its legislations. 

Four opposition centre-right parties won a total of 158 seats in 2002:
the Moderate Party, 55 seats, the Liberal Party (FP), 48; the Christian 
Democratic Party (Kd), 33; and the Centre Party (CP), 22 seats. In August
2004, they formed a coalition called the Alliance for Sweden. Although the
parties fielded candidates separately in the 2006 elections, they put
forward a single candidate for the post of prime minister, Mr. Fredrik
Reinfeldt, and presented a common manifesto entitled "More people at work -
more to share". The country's membership of NATO and its generous welfare
system were the main electoral issues in 2006. While the SAP argued for
maintenance of neutrality, the Alliance for Sweden called for Swedish
membership of NATO. The Alliance pledged to reform Sweden's cradle-to-grave
welfare policy by cutting employers' taxes and unemployment benefits. The
SAP accused the opposition of wanting to destroy the welfare state. 

In September 2006, the secretary of the FP resigned over a scandal
involving a worker of its youth branch, who had obtained a copy of the SAP's
electoral strategy by hacking into the SAP computer network. The incident
created a scandal in the country that partly overshadowed the election
campaign. 

A total of 81.99 per cent of the 6.9 million registered voters turned out 
at the polls. 

The SAP lost 14 seats, although it remained the largest party with 130
seats. Conversely, the Moderate Party increased its seats to 97, winning 42
more seats than in the 2002 elections. The FP, badly damaged by the hacking 
scandal, lost 20 seats, winning 28. The CP and the Kd won 29 and 24 seats 
respectively, thus giving the Alliance for Sweden a narrow majority in the 
new parliament with 178 seats. 

Prime Minister Göran Persson accepted defeat and resigned on 17 September 
2006. On the following day, the outgoing Speaker of parliament, Mr. Björn 
von Sydow, asked Mr. Reinfeldt to form a new government. Mr. Reinfeldt 
subsequently formed a centre-right coalition government with the parties 
that made up the Alliance for Sweden. His government took office on 6 
October 2006. 

The newly-elected Parliament held its first session on 2 October 2006
and elected Mr. Per Westerberg of the Moderate Party as its new Speaker."

(2) The survey is part of a panel study of the Swedish National Elections 
Study, which has a two-step ongoing design in which half of the sample is 
interviewed in connection with the previous election, and the other half
in connection with the succeeding election. However, for the CSES data, 
only the post-election part of the panel is being used.

The sample is meant to be representative of all Swedish citizens living in
Sweden and who are entitled to vote. Respondents were randomly selected at 
all stages of the sampling procedures. Excluded from the sample frame were 
the estimated 2 percent of the total eligible population, who live abroad. 
1547 respondents were interviewed of which 870 answered the full 
questionnaire and 269 a shortened version. 408 respondents answered a very
shortened extract. Which version a respondent answered was captured in 
variable C1007. Also see the election study note on C1007.

(3) There are no post-survey adjustment weights, thus there are no weights  
included in the data set.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "On 21 October 2007, elections were held for all 200 seats in the 
National Council and 41 of the 46 seats in the Council of States. The
SVP/UDC has moreover taken up its usual discourse of cutting taxes, 
keeping Switzerland out of the European Union and addressing the issue of
exploitation of the country's social and asylum policies. The election 
campaign was marked by an SVP/UDC poster showing a black sheep being kicked
out of Switzerland by three white sheep. Other parties also used their 
traditional election platforms, with the Socialists (SP/PS) calling for 
social security and solidarity, the Radical Democrats (FDP/PRD) urging 
further economic growth based on creativity and efficiency and the 
Christian Democrats (CVP/PDC) pledging to ensure job opportunities. 
The Greens (GPS/PES) campaigned for combating climate change, calling for
a ban on air shows in the country and the introduction of a jet fuel 
surcharge. [...] In all, 48.28 per cent of the country's 4.9 million 
eligible voters turned out at the polls, marking the highest turnout figure
since 1983.

In the elections to the National Council, the SVP/UDC and the GPS/PES made
the biggest gains (seven seats each), bringing their seats to 62 and 20 
respectively. The SVP/UDC obtained the largest share of seats in this 
chamber since the country's proportional voting system started in 1919.
The SP/PS, which took 43 seats, suffered a major defeat, losing nine seats.
The FDP/PRD also lost five, winning 31 seats. The remainder went to small 
parties."

(2) This is a post-election study, focused on the Swiss parliamentary
election of October 21, 2007. The CSES survey module was conducted in three
languages (German, French and Italian) and as a combination of a telephone 
and follow-up self completion survey (which could be completed either by as
mail-back or online questionnaire). The follow-up survey was completed by 
all respondents from the telephone sample willing to answer a supplementary
self-administered questionnaire. See variable C1007 to identify each sample
component. Total panel attrition was 27.59%. Sample for the telephone 
survey was drawn from the telephone register of households selected by the 
federal office of statistics. The sample had three components: a) A 
national sample of households with 2000 target respondents; b) An over-
sample in cantons (which correspond to the electoral districts) used to 
guarantee at least 100 respondents in each; c) An over-sample in 3 cantons 
used to guarantee at least 600 respondents in each (corresponding to 
Tessin, Zurich and Geneva). Within each household, respondents were 
randomly selected. Notice that the CSES module was only applied in sample 
(a) and (b), thus respondents from sample (c) in not included in the data 
set. Additionally, one canton (containing approximately 0.6% of the total 
population) was excluded from the sample since there was only one 
candidate, and thus, no election took place.

(3) The Swiss study includes two different weights. The first one is a
design weight that adjusts for oversampling of certain cantons (see point
2 for details of the sample design). The second weight is a cumulative
political weight that adjusts for sample bias in turnout and party choice
variables, in addition to the cantonal oversampling.

 >>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - TAIWAN (2008)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Unlike the past four presidential elections, the presidency in 2008 was
contested by candidates from just the two major parties.
With incumbent President Chen Shui-bian prevented by the constitutional 
term limit - two consecutive four-year terms - from running again,
the DPP fielded two veteran heavyweight politicians, Frank Hsieh and Su
Tseng-chang, as their presidential and vice-presidential candidates.
Hsieh won the DPP’s primary, triumphing over several other senior DPP
politicians. A lawyer by training and a gifted speaker, Hsieh has a wealth
of executive and legislative experience which includes being a legislator,
the mayor of Kaohsiung City, and the premier (the term used for the head
of the Executive Yuan, equivalent to a prime minister in a system with dual
executives). Like Hsieh, DPP vice-presidential candidate Su Tseng-chang is
also a DPP stalwart with a reputation as a feisty no-nonsense politician.
He too is a former legislator and premier, as well as having served as a
county magistrate (i.e. a regional chief executive). Both Hsieh and Su
served as premier under President Chen’s administration, Hsieh having 
resigned in early 2006 under a cloud of controversy and being replaced
by Su. Frank Hsieh, after serving only less than 14 months, resigned as 
premier in January 2006 after being dogged by investigations on a bribery
scandal in Kaohsiung that involved a close affiliate during his tenure as
mayor. Though Hsieh was not directly implicated nor indicted, he resigned
from the premiership to take management responsibility of the incident in
which his close affiliatewas indicted and later found guilty. As he was 
never indicted nor implicated, Hsieh was able to maintain his political
credibility and muster enough political support within the DPP to win as
the party’s presidential candidate despite stiff competition from several
DPP party heavyweights.

For the KMT, the charismatic former mayor of Taipei Ma Ying-jeou and former
economic affairs minister Vincent Siew were chosen to represent the party.
A Harvard educated lawyer, Ma has an impeccable image among Taiwanese 
citizens as the incorruptible ''Mr. Clean’’. Prior to being Taipei’s mayor,
a post he held between 1999 and 2007, Ma was a cabinet minister during 
President Lee Tenghui’s administration in the 1990s. Vincent Siew,
meanwhile, has been active in national politics since the 1980s and has
held cabinet-level portfolios in the area of economic affairs. Ma’s
selection of Siew as his running mate acknowledged the importance of the
economy in the 2008 election.

Two months after the KMT’s landslide victory in the legislative elections,
its candidate Ma Ying-jeou won a decisive victory in the presidential
election. At 76%, the turnout was high compared to participation levels in
many established democracies. However, the 2008 percentage showed a decline
of four points compared with 2004 and seven points compared with 2000. 
The Ma-Siew ticket won almost 60% of the vote, comfortably ahead of the
DPP’s Hsieh-Su team. For the DPP, this represented a decline of almost ten
percentage points compared with its support in the previous presidential
election. However, it is the 2004 figure that can be regarded as more 
exceptional; that election aside, the party’s support in both presidential
and legislative elections has remained within the 30-40% bracket. 
Nonetheless, and as in the legislative election, the margin of KMT victory
came as a surprise. An eve-of-election opinion poll conducted by the 
television station TVBS had shown Ma’s support to be just 51% support.
Moreover, the KMT’s candidate made inroads in areas traditionally 
considered as DPP strongholds. This has not been widely blamed on the 
DPP’s candidate Frank Hsieh, however. Instead the KMT’s resounding victory
has been attributed to Ma Ying-jeou’s unsullied image, the unpopularity of
the incumbent President Chen, and voters’ weariness with the political
stalemate and deadlock of the past eight years.

the past? Electoral Studies 28, 492-517. (quoted are: 503-504; 505-506).

(2) The sample is meant to be representative of eligible voters in Taiwan's
2008 presidential election. Taiwanese citizens are eligible from 20 years
of age onwards. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample 
frame.

For the sampling, the country was divided into six geographic regions,
then the proportions of samples for each region was estimated. 
73 single-member districts of the 2008 legislative election served as
primary sampling units (PSU). 

The secondary sampling units are villages or "li" and then, respondents
were systematically drawn from household registration list provided by
the Ministry of Interior. Based on the principle of probabilities 
proportional to the size (PPS), a total of 1,905 intervews were completed.
Around 16 respondents were sampled from every selected village or li.

(3) To generalize to the population of eligible voters
in the 2008 presidential election, the survey data should be weighted by 
ranking with gender, age (5 groups), education (5 groups), and area 
(6 regions). The demographic characteristics are based on "2007
Taiwan-Fuchien Demographic Fact Book Republic of China", published by the
Ministry of Interior Republic of China.

 >>> ELECTION SUMMARIES AND GENERAL NOTES - THAILAND (2007)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) "The December 2007 elections were the first to be held following a 
military takeover in September 2006 which ousted the then Prime Minister, 
Shinawatra Thaksin. His Thai Love Thai (Thai Rak Thai, TRT) party had won 
377 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives in the February 2005 
elections. However, his second term as prime minister lasted only one year. 
Following political allegations against his premiership, Mr. Thaksin 
dissolved the House of Representatives on 24 February 2006 and called early 
elections for 2 April. The elections were boycotted by the major opposition 
parties and invalidated by the Constitutional Tribunal on 8 May. New 
elections were subsequently scheduled for October 2006. As a result of the 
September takeover, these elections could not take place and the King 
appointed an interim legislative body, the National Legislative Assembly on
12 October 2006. 

The adoption of a new Constitution on 19 August 2007 opened the way to a 
return to democracy. At stake in the 2007 elections were the 480 seats in 
the new House of Representatives. 

The TRT had been dissolved by the Constitutional Tribunal in May 2006, and 
exiled former prime minister Thaksin was barred from running in the 2007 
elections, along with 111 former TRT executives. Mr. Thaksin's supporters 
formed the People's Power Party (PPP) prior to the elections, whose 
candidates included children of barred former TRT members. The PPP leader 
Mr. Samak Sundaravej pledged to allow Mr. Thaksin's return to the country 
so he could "prove his innocence". The PPP promised to give priority to 
economic recovery. 

The Democratic Party (DP, which took 96 seats in the 2005 elections), was 
led by Mr. Abhisit Vejjajiva. It pledged to fight corruption and improve 
the country's economic situation within 99 days. Its leader said his party 
would not join a PPP-led government. Other contenders included the 
Chartthai Party (meaning "Thai Nation" - CPT), led by Mr. Banharn 
Silpa-Archa and the Puea Pandin Party (meaning "For the Motherland" - PP) 
of Mr. Suwit Khunkitti. Former members of the TRT also contested the 
elections in other small parties. 

Most political parties promised to tackle corruption, provide better health
care, education and infrastructure, and at the same time improve the 
economy. Local analysts predicted none of the main parties would win an 
outright majority, and that the PPP would become the largest party. 
On 23 December, 74.45 per cent of the 44 million registered voters turned 
out at the poll. 

The PPP fared well in rural areas in the northern part of the country where 
the TRT had its stronghold, while the DP led in the capital Bangkok and in 
southern Thailand. 

Preliminary results gave the PPP 233 seats and the DP 165 seats, although 
the results for several seats were invalidated following allegations of 
vote-buying. Following the elections 5 parties, namely - the Ruam Jai Thai 
Chart Pattana Party, the Matchimathipataya Party and the Pracharaj Party, 
the CTP and the PP - agreed to participate in a PPP-led government. On 19
January 2008, the PPP leader, Mr. Sundaravej, officially announced a six-
party coalition controlling 315 of the 480 seats, leaving the Democrat Party
the sole opposition in the new House of Representatives. 

The House of Representatives held its first session on 21 January. On the 
following day, it elected the PPP deputy leader, Mr. Yongyuth Tiyapairat,
as its new Speaker. Following investigations into allegations of electoral 
fraud, Mr. Tiyapairat resigned as Speaker on 30 April and was replaced on
12 May by Mr. Chai Chidchob (PPP). 

On 28 January, the House of Representatives elected the PPP leader, Samak 
Sundaravej, as the new Prime Minister."

(2) The post election interviewing began at January 9, 2008, and ran until 
January 31, 2008, as face-to-face interviews. The current sample population
was meant to be representative of all eligible Thai voters, aged 18 years 
and older and having the Thai citizenship. However, Thailand's electoral 
law excludes monks, novices, Brahmin priests and clergies from the right to
vote. The sample was selected in a three-stage probability sample process. 
Based upon clusters of legislative districts, voting units have been 
selected in which voters were chosen by systematic sampling based on voter 
lists. Overall, out of the 145 legislative districts of Thailand, 50 have 
been selected, including 100 voting units in total. The respondents had not 
been informed before the first contact for an interview. Prior to the 
interview, a small gift (a pen) was given to respondents. Detailed 
information about the interviewer, their gender, age, training or any 
instruction were not available.

(3) The original data, provided by Thailand, did not include any kind of
weights. Furthermore, due to the sampling procedure, weights are not 
necessary to make the sample representative for the whole Thai population.
